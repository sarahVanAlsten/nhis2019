For analyses using the household as the unit of analysis (e.g., how many households contained a person who needed help with activities of daily living?), researchers should use the household weight. 

Rather than using HHWEIGHT, researchers should use PERWEIGHT or SAMPWEIGHT when analyzing person-level variables or variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward.

The geographic information included in REGION was added during processing, rather than ascertained via questioning.  REGION is the smallest geographic unit identified in the IPUMS NHIS data for 1985 forward.  In 1968-1984, a limited number (under 30) metropolitan areas were also identified (METAREA).

The four regions--Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, and West--correspond to the U.S. regions recognized by the Census Bureau. Divisions and states included in the four regions are as follows:

Northeast:  New England Division (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and Middle Atlantic Division (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)

North Central/Midwest: East North Central Division (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin) and West North Central Division (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska)

South: South Atlantic Division (Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida), East South Central Division (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama), and West South Central Division (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana)

For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the section of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, 
race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 


Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.

      <txt><![CDATA[SUPP1WT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that harmonizes the sampling weights for a select subset of the supplements of the original NHIS public use files.  In this case, harmonization refers to putting weights from various years and source supplement files into a single, consistently named variable. 

The majority of weights included in SUPP1WT come from the supplement surveys for childhood immunization (years 1992-2003), smoking (1978-1980), family medical expenses (1975-1976), and AIDS knowledge and attitudes (1987-1995). In some cases, SUPP1WT represents a randomly selected person from a household; for example, a sample person age 18 and older was selected for the 1990 AIDS supplement. In other cases, the survey was also administered to all persons within a specific age group; for example, the 1998 childhood immunization supplement was administered to a sample child under 18 plus all children age 12-35 months. SUPP1WT represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

Beginning in 2011, the weights included in SUPP1WT are associated with variables from the Functioning and Disability supplement.

      <labl>Sexual orientation</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults ages 18 and older, SEXORIEN reports the person's sexual orientation. Respondents were asked "Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?" Response options included: "gay" or "lesbian", "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay", "bisexual", "something else", and "I don't know the answer". The wording of the question differed slightly for men and women, with men being asked if they are "gay" or "straight, that is, not gay" and women being asked if they are "lesbian or gay" or "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay". Persons who responded "something else" or "I don't know the answer" were asked follow-up questions about what they meant by "something else" or "don't know," but due to sample size constraints, those responses are not included in the publicly-available data.

SEXORIEN was first introduced in 2013. Users interested in learning more about the cognitive testing involved in developing the NHIS sexual orientation questions can refer to the NHIS question evaluation report [URL omitted from DDI.].]]></txt>

The values for NUMPREC do not always agree with those for FAMSIZE.

Users may be interested in using the IPUMS NHIS family interrelationship variables instead of MOMED. These variables allow users to identify a person's (probable) coresident spouse/partner and/or parent(s), and make it easy to include characteristics about these family members as new variables in their data extracts. When using the IPUMS family interrelationship variables, not only can users attach information about a parent's education, but can also attach other characteristics of interest, such as parent's race, labor force status, and health insurance coverage, as new variables.

If the response to this question was "refused" or "don't know," the interviewer tried to collect the information via an alternatively phrased question: "About how long have you been in the United States?"   

The data included in the public use files for YRSINUS are recodes of the responses to these questions, with each answer in the form of a calendar year converted to a number of years present.

      <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

      <labl>Employment status in past 1 to 2 weeks</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT reports whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or were looking for work or on layoff during the preceding two weeks (for 1969-1996) or during the preceding week (for 1997 forward).

In 1969-1996, EMPSTAT is a summary recode of responses to a series of questions. 

In 1969-1973 interviewers first asked, "Did [person] work at any time last week or the week before - (For females): not counting work around the house?" This question was also asked in 1974-1981, but the wording in these years omitted the instructions "For females" before the phrase "not counting work around the house." In 1982-1996 the question wording was changed to, "During those 2 weeks, did [person] work at any time at a job or business, not counting work around the house? (Include unpaid work in the family farm/business.)

If the answer to the initial question asked in 1969-1996 was negative, interviewers asked whether the person had a job or business, even though he/she did not work during the reference period. The final questions used to categorize current employment status in 1969-1996 were, "Was he looking for work or on layoff from a job [during those 2 weeks]?" and, if yes, "Which--looking for work or on layoff from a job?"


In 1997 forward, respondents were asked one general question to ascertain their employment status. 

Interviewers asked, "Which of the following was [person] doing last week?"  In 1997-2000 interviewers read the following possible responses: "Working at a job or business," "With a job or business but not at work," "Looking for work," and "Not working at a job or business."  Beginning in 2001, the response category "Working at a job or business" was split into two separate categories, "Working for pay at a job or business" and "Working, but not for pay, at a job or business."  The rest of the response categories in 2001 forward are the same as in 1997-2000.


Definitions and Instructions

1969-1981: Work

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1969-1981 stated that "work" included "paid work as an employee for someone else for wages, salary, commission, or pay 'in kind' (meals, living quarters, or supplies provided in place of cash wages)." The Manuals also instructed interviewers to include work in the person's own business, professional practice or farm and work without pay in a business or farm (or, beginning in 1980, a professional practice) run by a "relative" (1969-1970) or a "related household member" (1971-1981).

The Manuals instructed interviewers to exclude work around the house and volunteer or unpaid work. In 1971-1979 and 1981, interviewers were also instructed to exclude service in the Armed Forces. In 1980, however, interviewers were specifically instructed to include service in the Armed Forces as work.

According to the 1969-1981 Manuals, persons were to be counted as having worked if they worked at any time during the reference period, "even for an hour."


1982 forward: Work

The Manuals for 1982 forward included more detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for what was to be counted as work. The types of activities included and excluded as work varied across different time periods, and several activities included as work in some years were excluded in other years (e.g., serving on jury duty). According to the Manuals, the following activities were to be included as work:

In 1982-2000

Working for pay (wages, salary, commission, piecework rates, tips, "pay-in-kind" such as meals, living quarters, or supplies provided in place of cash wages)
Working for profit or fees in one's own business, professional practice, partnership, or farm even though the effort may produce a financial loss
Working without pay in a business or farm operated by a related household member.

In 1982-2000

Working as a civilian employee of the National Guard or Department of Defense.

In 1982-1996

Participating in "exchange work" or "share work" on a farm.

In 1982-1986

Serving on jury duty.

In 1997 forward

Participating in a government sponsored work program such as Public Employment Program (PEP), Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), Foster Grandparent Program, Work Incentive Program (WIN), etc.

In 2001 forward

Working as a military or civilian employee of the National Guard or Department of Defense.
At least 15 hours of work per week without pay in a business or farm operated by a related household member.

The Manuals instructed interviewers to exclude the following activities as work:

In 1982 forward

Unpaid work which does not contribute to the operation of a family business or farm (e.g., home housework)
Unpaid work for a related household member who is a salaried employee and does not operate a farm or business (e.g., typing for a husband who is a lawyer for a corporation)
Unpaid work for an unrelated household member or for a relative who is not a household member
Volunteer or other unpaid work for a church, charity, political candidate, club, or other organization, such as the Red Cross, Community Fund, etc.
Owning a business solely as an investment to which no contribution is made to the management or actual operation (e.g., owning a grocery store which someone else manages and operates)

In 1982-2000

Service in the Armed Forces, including time while on temporary duty with the National Guard or Reserves

In 1987 forward

Serving on jury duty

In 1997 forward

Participating in a government sponsored program such as Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) if it involves only training in a school or other institutional setting, and does not include on-the-job training (if it includes a combination of on-the-job training and classroom training, consider the person as working; count only the time spent on the job as working).

In 2001 forward

Unpaid internships.

As in earlier years, the Manuals for 1982-1996 instructed interviewers to count persons as having worked if they worked at any time during the reference period, "even for an hour."


1969-1981: Job

The 1969-1981 Field Representative's Manuals define a job as "when [a person] has a definite arrangement with one or more employers to work for pay (full-time or part-time)." The Manuals also provide instructions for seasonal jobs and persons "on call." The 1969 Manual reads:

Seasonal employment is considered a job only during the season and not during the off-season.
A person "on call" to work only when his services are needed is not considered to have a job during weeks when he does not work.

The Manuals for 1970-1981 include similarly worded instructions for "seasonal employment" and "persons 'on call'."


1982 forward: Job

The definition for "job" and instructions for "seasonal employment," and "persons 'on call'" included in the Field Representative's Manuals for 1982 forward are similar to those included in earlier years. The 1982 forward Manuals add, "A formal, definite arrangement with one or more employers to work a specified number of hours per week or days per month, but on an irregular schedule during the week or month, is also considered a job."

The Manuals also included the following additional instructions:

Consider school personnel (teachers, administrators, custodians, etc.) who have a definite arrangement, either written or oral, to return to work in the fall as having a "job" even though they may be on summer vacation.

Consider persons who have definite arrangements to receive pay while on leave of absence from their regular jobs to attend school, travel, etc., as having a "job." This may be referred to as "sabbatical leave." Probe to determine if the person is receiving pay if this is not volunteered.

Do not consider a person who did not work at an unpaid job on a family farm or in a family business during the past 2 weeks as having a "job."

Do not consider persons who do not have a definite job to which they can return as having a "job." For example, do not consider a person to have a job if his/her job has been phased out or abolished, or if the company has closed down operations.


1969-1981: Business

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1969-1970 and 1974-1981 provide the following definition for business:

A person has his own business (including a farm operation or professional practice) if he does one of the following:

Maintains an office, store, or other place of business.
Uses machinery or equipment in which he has invested money for profit.
Advertises his business or profession.

The Manuals for 1969-1970 also stated, "Casual workers who work for themselves such as itinerant handymen or other odd job workers are not considered to have a business during weeks when they do not work."

No definition for business was included in the Manuals for 1971-1973.


1982 forward: Business

The definition for business included in the Field Representative's Manuals for 1982 forward was similar to that included in 1974-1981, with the following instructions added:

Consider the selling of newspapers, cosmetics, and the like as a business if the person buys the newspapers, magazines, cosmetics, etc., directly from the publisher, manufacturer, or distributor, sells them to the consumer, and bears any losses resulting from failure to collect from the consumer. Otherwise, consider it as working for pay (job) rather than a business.

Do not consider domestic work in other persons' homes, casual work such as that performed by a craft worker or odd-job carpenter or plumber as a business. This is considered as wage work. Whether or not the person is considered as having a job is described in [the definition for work].

Do not consider the sale of personal property as a business.

For questionable or borderline cases, do not consider the persons as having their own business. Refer to [the definition for job] to determine whether the person is considered as having a job.


1969-1981: Having a Job or Business

As noted above, prior to 1997, respondents who did not report having worked during the reference period received a follow-up question that asked whether they had a job or business, even though they did not work during the reference period. For this question, the Field Representative's Manual for 1969-1979 instructed interviewers

[C]onsider as having a job or business a person who was temporarily absent from his job or business all of last week and the week before because of vacation, bad weather, labor dispute, or personal reasons such as illness but who expects to return when these events are ended. Also mark "Yes" for a person who says that he has a new job which he has not yet started but enter a footnote, "New job--not yet started."

The 1980-1981 Manuals included similarly worded instructions that also instructed interviewers to "consider school personnel (teachers, administrators, custodians, etc.) who have a definite arrangement, either written or oral, to return to work next fall as having a 'job,' even though they may be on summer vacation."


1982-1996: Having a Job or Business

As in earlier years, the Field Representative's Manuals for 1982-1996 instructed interviewers to consider as having a job or business persons who were temporarily absent but who expected to return to their job or business when the event ended.

The Manuals for 1982-1996 instructed interviewers not to consider persons to have a job if they were waiting to begin a new job. However, if the person was waiting to being his or her own business, professional practice, or farm, interviewers were to count the person as having a job or business if he or she spent any time during the reference period making or completing arrangements for the opening.

Persons on maternity/paternity leave were to be considered as having a job if they intended to return to work and the employer had agreed to hold the job or find him/her a place when he/she returned. Persons on layoff were not to be considered as having a job.

The 1982-1986 Manuals also provided the following general guidelines for how to determine employment status for enrollees in government-sponsored work and training programs:

Consider the person as working if he/she receives any pay for the work or on-the-job training.
Do not consider the person as working or with a job if he/she receives training at schools or other institutional settings.
Do not consider the person as working or with a job if he/she receives welfare or public assistance while participating in work programs as a condition for receiving the welfare (work relief) or participating voluntarily.

Beginning in 1987, these guidelines were changed so that persons who received welfare or public assistance while participating in work programs as a condition for receiving the welfare (work relief) or participating voluntarily were considered as working or with a job.


1969-1981: Looking for Work and On Layoff

The 1969-1981 Field Representative's Manuals provided the following definitions for "Looking for Work" and "On Layoff":

 Looking for Work:

Looking for work refers to any effort to get a job or to establish a business or profession. A person was looking for work if he actually tried to find work during the past two weeks and also if he made such efforts previously (i.e., within the past 60 days) and was waiting during the past two weeks to hear the results of these earlier efforts.

Some examples of looking for work are: registering at an employment office; visiting, telephoning, or writing applications to prospective employers; placing or answering advertisements for a job; and being 'on call' at a personnel office or at a union hiring hall, etc.

On Layoff:

A person is said to be on layoff if he is waiting to be called back to a job from which he has been temporarily laid off or furloughed. Layoffs can be due to slack work, plant retooling or remodeling, seasonal factors, and the like. If a person was not working because of a labor dispute at his own place of employment, he is not to be considered 'on layoff' but with a job from which he is absent.


1982-1996: Looking for Work and On Layoff

The 1982-1996 Field Representative's Manuals provided the following definition for "Looking for Work":

Looking for Work:

Any effort to get a job or to establish a business or profession. A person was looking for work if he/she actually tried to find work during the past 2 weeks. Some examples of looking for work are:

Registering at a public or private employment office.
Meeting with or telephoning prospective employers.
Placing or answering advertisements (NOTE: simply reading want-ads does not qualify as looking for work).
Writing letters of application.
Visiting locations where prospective employers pick up temporary help.

Also, consider persons "on call" at a personnel office, union hiring hall, professional register, etc., as looking for work.

The definition for "On Layoff" included in the 1982-1996 Manuals was similar to that included in earlier years.

The 1982-1996 Manuals provided additional instructions concerning who should be counted as looking for work or on layoff in "special situations." These instructions are summarized below:

Retooling Operations/Plan Shutdowns

Some establishments go through a retooling operation before new models come out (e.g., automobile and boat manufacturers). Consider persons "on layoff" if they did not work during the reference period for this reason.
Persons who were on vacation during a retooling operation/plant shutdown are not to be considered "on layoff."

School Personnel

Do not consider school personnel to be on layoff during the summer if they have a definite agreement to return to work in the fall, unless the person was laid off from a summer job or was looking for work.

Persons on Strike

Do not consider as on layoff, a person who is on strike, is locked out, or does not wish to cross a picket line, even though he/she is not a member of the group on strike. This applies only when the labor dispute is at the person's place of employment. If a person has been laid off because of a shortage of materials or slack work resulting from a strike in another plant and is not on strike him/herself, consider them as on layoff.

Persons Waiting to Start a New Job

Persons who are waiting to begin a new job within 30 days of the interview and were not on layoff during the reference period are considered "looking for work."
Persons are waiting to begin a job within 30 days but who were on layoff during the reference period are considered both "looking for work" and "on layoff."
Persons who are waiting to begin a new job within 31+ days of the interview are asked whether they were temporarily absent, on layoff, or looking for work during the reference period. Persons who answer "on layoff" and/or "looking for a job" are counted as such; persons who answer "temporarily absent" are not counted as "on layoff" or "looking for work."
Persons who are waiting to begin a new job within 31+ days of the interview and who were not temporarily absent or on layoff from a job or were not looking for work are not considered "looking for work" or "on layoff."

In 1984 the following special situation was added:

If a person has more than one job and was absent from both jobs for different reasons, [consider as "looking for work" or "on layoff] if he/she was on layoff from either job or was looking for work regardless of the reason absent from either job.


1997 forward: Looking for Work

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000 provided the following definition for "looking for work":

To be looking for work, a person has to have conducted an active job search. An active job search means that the person took steps necessary to put him/herself in a position to be hired for a job. Active job search methods include:

Filled out applications or sent out resumes
Placed or answered classified ads
Checked union/professional registers
Bid on a contract or auditioned for a part in a play
Contacted friends or relatives about possible jobs
Contacted school/college university employment office
Contacted employment directly

Job search methods that are not active include:

Looked at ads without responding to them
Picked up a job application without filling it out

The Manuals for 2001 forward provide a similarly worded definition for "looking for work."


Coding Instructions

The first digit of the coding system for EMPSTAT groups all adults (age 17+ in 1969-1981, age 18+ in 1982 forward) into one of four main categories: employed, with a job but not at work, unemployed, and not in the labor force. These categories correspond to main employment status categories recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and are used in other sources such as the Current Population Survey and the U.S. census. The second digit supplies additional detail, such as whether the person was looking for work versus being on lay-off, was working for pay or without pay, or straddled two categories, such as simultaneously having a job from which they were absent and looking for work.]]></txt>

      <labl>Above or below poverty threshold</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[POORYN indicates whether family income was above or below poverty level.  The poverty status of a family group is assigned to each member of the family, thus making POORYN a person-level variable.  Poverty status is also calculated for adults who live alone or with persons they are not related to; in such cases, POORYN is calculated based on the individual's income.   

Data Collection

Respondents were asked to look at a card listing broad income categories and to identify the category that most closely matched their family's before-tax total combined money income from all sources during the preceding calendar year.  

Total combined family income included the respondent's own income plus the income of all co-resident family members, including cohabiting partners and related armed forces members living at home.  It did not include the value of noncash benefits such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, and public housing.     


To determine poverty status, the reported total family income was compared to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for the year in question.  These thresholds are based not only on income but also on family size and the number of children under age 18.  

If the reported family income figure was the same or higher than the poverty threshold for families of that size and age composition, the individual (and all members of the family) was considered "above poverty" and received a code of 1 in POORYN.  If the reported family income figure was less than the Census Bureau's poverty cut-off for families of that size and age composition, the individual (and all other members of the family) was classified as "poor" and received a code of 2 in POORYN.


Basis of Poverty Definition

Poverty data in IPUMS NHIS and in U.S. government statistics generally are based on a definition established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently modified by Federal interagency committees in 1969 and 1980.  The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Directive 14 prescribes this definition as the official poverty measure for federal agencies to use in their statistical work.

At the core of this definition was the 1961 economy food plan, the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture.  It was determined from the Agriculture Department's 1955 survey of food consumption that families of three or more persons spend approximately one-third of their income on food; hence, the poverty level for these families was set at three times the cost of the economy food plan.  For smaller families and for persons living alone, the cost of the economy food plan was multiplied by factors that were slightly higher, to compensate for the relatively larger fixed expenses for these smaller households.  The federally established poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index.  The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country; they are not adjusted for regional, state, or local variations in the cost of living.

      <txt><![CDATA[INCIMP1 is a variable that includes imputed values to replace missing data for the original variable INCFAM97ON2, a recoded variable of total combined family income (from all sources) in the previous calendar year. The complementary imputation flag variable IMPYFAMFLAG1 indicates whether responses in INCIMP1 were reported or imputed.

Related Variables and Sources of Additional Information

INCIMP1 is the first of five variables that contain imputed values for total family income. It was created as part of a set of variables that provide complete (i.e., without missing values) data on family income. 


One of the purposes of NHIS data is to study relationships between income and health and to monitor health and health care for persons at different income levels.  However, as the technical documentation on "Multiple Imputation of  Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey: Methods and Examples" [URL omitted from DDI.] describes, non-response rates are high for questions on total family income in the previous calendar year and personal earnings from employment in the previous calendar year.  For more information on the imputation methodology, see EMPSTATIMP1.

Before using the imputed income and earnings variables, researchers are strongly advised to read the NCHS documentation on imputed income, such as 2018 Imputed Family/Personal Earnings Files [URL omitted from DDI.].  This documentation cautions that each of the five datasets must be merged with other data from the survey to form a single completed dataset.  For IPUMS NHIS data users, the imputed income files have already been merged with other data from each survey year for 1997 through the current year of data, as part of the process of adding these imputed income files and variables to the IPUMS NHIS database.  
 

The NCHS documentation for the imputed income files directs that analysis of the five versions of each imputed income variable should be done separately, using methods and software that are appropriate for such survey data (for example, SAS-callable SUDAAN or SAS-callable IVEware).  


Only then can estimates and standard errors be combined using the combining rules described in the aforementioned document on "Multiple Imputation of Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey."  The 2018 imputed income file documentation further warns:

The extra variability due to imputation CANNOT be incorporated by simply analyzing a SINGLE completed data set as if the imputed values were true values. Moreover, analysts SHOULD NOT create a single competed data set using the AVERAGE of the five sets of imputed values. 

Examples of correct data analyses and additional information about the procedures used to create the imputed data are provided in the technical documentation referred to above.

      <txt><![CDATA[INCIMP2 is a variable that includes imputed values to replace missing data for the original variable INCFAM97ON2, a recoded variable of total combined family income (from all sources) in the previous calendar year. The complementary imputation flag variable IMPYFAMFLAG2 indicates whether responses in INCIMP2 were reported or imputed.   

Related Variables and Sources of Additional Information

INCIMP2 is the second of five variables that contain imputed values for total family income.  It was created as part of a set of variables that provide complete (i.e., without missing values) data on family income. 

One of the purposes of NHIS data is to study relationships between income and health and to monitor health and health care for persons at different income levels. However, non-response rates are high for questions on total family income and personal earnings from employment in the previous calendar year.   To obtain estimates of these variables for all survey participants, the National Center for Health Statistics created variables with values imputed for missing data for 1997 forward, using multiple-imputation methodology.  The NHIS public use files with multiply imputed data consist of five files (and thus five versions of variables containing imputed values for missing data), one for each set of imputed values, to allow the assessment of variability due to imputation.  For more information on the imputation methodology, see EMPSTATIMP1.

Before using the imputed income and earnings variables, researchers are strongly advised to read the NCHS documentation on imputed income, such as 2018 Imputed Family/Personal Earnings Files [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Multiple Imputation of Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey: Methods and Examples" [URL omitted from DDI.].

The NHIS public use files with multiply imputed data consist of five files (and thus five versions of variables containing imputed values for missing data), one for each set of imputed values, to allow the assessment of variability due to imputation.  For more information on the imputation methodology, see EMPSTATIMP1.

Before using the imputed income and earnings variables, researchers are strongly advised to read the NCHS documentation on imputed income, such as 2018 Imputed Family/Personal Earnings Files [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Multiple Imputation of Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey: Methods and Examples" [URL omitted from DDI.].

      <txt><![CDATA[INCIMP5 is a variable that includes imputed values to replace missing data for the original variable INCFAM97ON2, a recoded variable of total combined family income (from all sources) in the previous calendar year. The complementary imputation flag variable IMPYFAMFLAG5 indicates whether responses in INCIMP5 were reported or imputed.   

Related Variables and Sources of Additional Information

INCIMP4 is the fifth of five variables that contain imputed values for total family income.  It was created as part of a set of variables that provide complete (i.e., without missing values) data on family income. 

One of the purposes of NHIS data is to study relationships between income and health and to monitor health and health care for persons at different income levels. However, non-response rates are high for questions on total family income and personal earnings from employment in the previous calendar year.   To obtain estimates of these variables for all survey participants, the National Center for Health Statistics created variables with values imputed for missing data for 1997 forward, using multiple-imputation methodology.  The NHIS public use files with multiply imputed data consist of five files (and thus five versions of variables containing imputed values for missing data), one for each set of imputed values, to allow the assessment of variability due to imputation.

      <txt><![CDATA[EARNINGS reports the individual's total earnings during the previous calendar year. Persons age 18 and older who had worked for pay during the previous calendar year, and, in 1997-2000 only, who reported having worked at a job or business last week (EMPSTAT) were asked, "What is your best estimate of [person's] earnings (include hourly wages, salaries, tips and commissions) before taxes and deductions from ALL jobs or businesses in [last calendar year]?" Interviewers recorded responses in non-intervalled amounts (ranging from 1 to 999,995+ dollars), but the data were recoded into 11 broad intervals in the original NHIS public use files.

Definitions of Earnings

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward provided detailed instructions for what to include and exclude as earnings. The types of income included and excluded as earnings varied across time, and several types of income included as earnings in some years were excluded in other years (e.g., Veteran's payments). 

According to the Manuals, the following types of income were to be included as earnings:

In 1997 forward:

Wages and salaries including tips, commissions, Armed Forces pay and cash bonuses, as well as subsistence allowances.
Net income from unincorporated businesses, professional practices, farms, or from rental property. ("Net" means after deducting business expenses, but before deducting personal taxes.)

In 1997-2000:

Social Security, or Supplemental Security Income.
Retirement, disability, and survivors pensions.
Interest and dividends.
Cash public assistance payments (welfare), excluding food stamps.
Veteran's payments.
Unemployment or workman's compensation.
Alimony and child support.'
Money regularly received from friends or relatives not living in the household.
Other periodic money income.

The Manuals instructed interviewers to exclude the following as earnings:

In 1997 forward:

Income " in kind", such as the value of room and board, free meals in restaurants, food stamps, free or reduced rent, value of crops produced by a farmer but consumed by his/her family, etc.
Lump sum payments of any kind, such as insurance payments, inheritances, or retirement.
Occasional gifts of money from persons not living in the household or any exchange of money between relatives living in the same household.
Money received from selling one's own house, car, or other personal property.
Withdrawals of savings from banks, retirement funds, or loans.
Tax refunds or any other refund or rebate.

In 2001 forward:

Social Security, or Supplemental Security Income
Income from retirement, disability, and survivors pensions
Income from interest and dividends
Cash public assistance payments (welfare)
Veteran's payments
Unemployment or workman's compensation
Alimony and child support
Money regularly received from friends or relatives not living in the household
Other periodic money income

      <txt><![CDATA[POVERTY reports the ratio of family income to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for the year in question. The poverty status of a family group is assigned to each member of the family, thus making POVERTY a person-level variable. The ratio of income to the poverty threshold is also calculated for adults who live alone or with persons they are not related to; in such cases, POVERTY is based on the individual's income.

Values for POVERTY range from less than half of the poverty threshold for a family of a given size and age structure (i.e., with a given number of children under 18) to five or more times the poverty threshold for a family of a given size and age structure.  For families where the number of children under age 18 in the family is equivalent to the number of family members, family income is presumed to be nonexistent, and the ratio of such nonexistent income to the poverty line is undefinable (with a code of 98 in POVERTY).  

The ratio of family income to the official poverty threshold in POVERTY is available only for 1997 forward.  The dichotomous variable POORYN, which distinguishes persons with family income at or above the poverty threshold from persons with family income below the poverty threshold, is available for 1982 forward.  For detailed discussion of the basis of the Census Bureau's official poverty thresholds, users should consult the variable description for POORYN.]]></txt>

      <labl>Ratio of family income to poverty threshold (4 categories)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[POVERTY2 reports the ratio of family income to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for the year in question. The poverty status of a family group is assigned to each member of the family, thus making POVERTY2 a person-level variable. The ratio of income to the poverty threshold is also calculated for adults who live alone or with persons they are not related to; in such cases, POVERTY2 is based on the individual's income.

Values for POVERTY2 range from less than half of the poverty threshold for a family of a given size and age structure (i.e., with a given number of children under 18) to five or more times the poverty threshold for a family of a given size and age structure.  For families where the number of children under age 18 is equivalent to the number of family members, family income is presumed to be nonexistent, and the ratio of such nonexistent income to the poverty line is undefinable (with a code of 98 in POVERTY2).  POVERTY2 differs from an alternate poverty ratio variable POVERTY, because POVERTY2 provides additional categories with greater income detail.

The ratio of family income to the official poverty threshold in POVERTY2 is available only for 1997 forward.  The dichotomous variable POORYN, which distinguishes persons with family income at or above the poverty threshold from persons with family income below the poverty threshold, is available for 1982 forward.  For a detailed discussion of the basis of the Census Bureau's official poverty thresholds, users should consult the variable description for POORYN.]]></txt>

      <labl>Ratio of imputed family income to poverty threshold</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[POVIMP5 is a variable that includes imputed values to replace missing data for the original variable POVERTY, which reports the ratio of family income to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for the year in question.  Values were imputed for families who did not supply adequate income information and for families where the number of children equaled the number of family members.  (See POVIMP1 for a more detailed discussion.) The complementary imputation flag variable IMPOVFLAG5 indicates whether responses in POVIMP5 were reported or imputed.

Related Variables and Sources of Additional Information

POVIMP5 is the fifth of five variables with imputed values for the ratio of family income to the poverty threshold.  It was created as part of a set of variables that provide complete (i.e., without missing values) data on family income. 

One of the purposes of NHIS data is to study relationships between income and health and to monitor health and health care for persons at different income levels. However, non-response rates are high for questions on total family income and personal earnings from employment in the previous calendar year.   To obtain estimates of these variables for all survey participants, the National Center for Health Statistics created variables with values imputed for missing data for 1997 forward, using multiple-imputation methodology.  The NHIS public use files with multiply imputed data consist of five files (and thus five versions of variables containing imputed values for missing data), one for each set of imputed values, to allow the assessment of variability due to imputation.  For more information on the imputation methodology, see EMPSTATIMP1.


Before using the imputed income and earnings variables, researchers are strongly advised to read the NCHS documentation on imputed income.

This includes such sources as 2018 Imputed Family/Personal Earnings Files [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Multiple Imputation of Family Income and Personal Earnings in the National Health Interview Survey: Methods and Examples" [URL omitted from DDI.].

      <txt><![CDATA[FSRAWSCORE reports family's raw score on the 30-day food security scale. It ranges from 0-10 and reflects the number of affirmative responses to the ten food insecurity questions that correspond with the following variables:  FSRUNOUT,  FSNOTLAST,
 FSBALANC, FSSKIP,  FSSKIPNO,  FSATELESS,
 FSHUNGRY,  FSWEIGHT,  FSNOTEAT, and  FSNOTEATNO. 

For more information on how affirmative responses were determined, please select more. Please see the comparability tab for details on possible changes in comparability over time.


Although FSSKIPNO and FSNOEATNO are continuous variables, a response is considered affirmative if number of days ranges from 1-30. For the other 8 variables, responses including "often true," "sometimes true," and "yes" are considered affirmative. 

The purpose of the Food Security supplement in the Family Questionnaire is to assess whether the individual's family has been able to afford adequate food for all adults during the previous 30 days. These questions are sponsored by the Economic Research Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons in families for whom it whom it was often or sometimes true in the last 30 days that they worried that food would run out before they got money to buy more, or that food that was bought didn't last and they didn't have money to get more, or that they couldn't afford to eat balanced meals, FSWEIGHT indicates whether the family respondent (or any other adults in the family in quarters 3 and 4 of 2013 only) lost weight because there wasn't enough money for food in the past 30 days. 

The variable FSWEIGHT combines different versions of this question which were tested in different quarters in 2013; for more details see the comparability tab as well as the "universe" tab and the "code" tab for more information on changes in the universe and the responses.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults aged 55 and older in 1984 and for all persons from 1993 forward, OWNERSHIP indicates whether the house/apartment that the sample person is living in is owned or being bought, rented, or is occupied by some other arrangement by the person or someone in her/his family or household.

This variable was first introduced in 1984 as part of the Supplement on Aging. From 1993 to 1996, this variable is part of the Family Resources supplement that provides information on individuals' health benefits, amount of coverage and income received from employment, welfare benefits, public assistance, and savings.

Questions in the Family Resources supplement are different from those in the core survey in terms of the content and the treatment of missing data. Questions in the Family Resources were normally asked of the month prior to the interview while the core survey asked of the last calendar year. All missing data in the Family Resources supplement were imputed by NHIS. Users can refer to the imputation flag variables OWNFL, RENTMONEYFL, and RENTFREEFL to identify persons with imputed data.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample persons living in a rented house or apartment, LOWRENT indicates whether the respondent or anyone in the respondent's family was paying lower rent because the federal, state, or local government was paying part of the cost.

Government housing assistance may come in the form of monetary assistance to help pay rent, a program called "Section 8," direct payments to landlords, vouchers, or other types of assistance from a local housing authority. Living in public housing is considered housing assistance from the government.

      <txt><![CDATA[WEIGHT reports the approximate weight of adults, in pounds.  The values for this variable are based on self-reports or proxy reports/estimates by respondents for other household members, supplied in response to the question, "About how much does [person] weigh without shoes?"  

Such verbally reported data are less accurate than, and thus not fully comparable to, data on weight gleaned via direct measurement in other surveys, such as NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics).  Indeed, the Field Representative's Manual for 1991 specified that one rationale for collecting height and weight data in the NHIS was to compare respondents' answers to the distribution of actual body measurements obtained in the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, "to determine the reliability of self-reported or proxy-reported heights and weights."]]></txt>

WEIGHT is a 3-digit-numeric variable. The upper and lower weight thresholds for public data suppression vary over time.  User should carefully review the codes below before making cross-year comparisons or interpreting results. 

1997-forward codes
000:	Not in Universe 
99: 	99 pounds or less (FEMALES only, 1997-2005)
100: 	100 pounds or less (FEMALES only, 2006-forward)
126: 	126 pounds or less (MALES only, 1997-forward)
259: 	259 pounds or more (FEMALES only, 1997-2005)
274: 	274 pounds or more (FEMALES only, 2006-forward)
285: 	285 pounds or more (MALES only, 1997-2005)
299: 	299 pounds or more (MALES only, 2006-forward)
996:	Exceptionally low or high weight
997:	Unknown-refused
998:	Unknown-not ascertained
999:	Unknown-don't know

In 1997-forward, data are NOT top and bottom coded, but instead cases outside of these upper and lower bounds are assigned to a code of "996: Exceptionally low or high weight". Additionally, these thresholds differ by sex.

Pre-1997 codes:
000:	Not in Universe (includes 2 reported "0" values in 1974, which has no bottom-code)
50: 	50 pounds or less (1976-1995)
97: 	97 pounds or less (1996)
290: 	290 pounds or more (1996)
300: 	300 pounds or more (1976 and 1978)
400: 	400 pounds or more (1977, 1979-1981)
500: 	500 pounds or more (1982-1995)
997: 	997 pounds or more (1974)
995:	Unknown - all causes]]></codInstr>

      <labl>Body Mass Index, calculated from publicly released height and weight variables</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[BMICALC reports the Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women, as calculated by IPUMS NHIS from the public use file data on height and weight.  BMICALC was calculated using the following formula: [Weight in pounds/(Height in inches, squared)] multiplied by 703 and rounded to one digit past the implied decimal point.  Individuals not asked their weight and height are coded "000" (for "Not in universe") for BMICALC.   Individuals whose weight or height was topcoded, bottomcoded, or, for 1997 forward, an outlying value that was suppressed for confidentiality reasons, receive a code of "996" for BMICALC.

The website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on BMI reports the following "standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults."  BMI below 18.5 is associated with "underweight" weight status; BMI 18.5 to 24.9 is associated with "normal" weight status; BMI 25.0 to 29.9 is associated with "overweight" weight status; BMI 30.0 and above is associated with "obese" weight status.  


The CDC website also notes, "the correlation between the BMI number and body fatness is fairly strong; however, the correlation varies by sex, race, and age."  For example, women tend to have more body fat than men at the same BMI; older people, on average, tend to have more body fat than young adults; and highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness.  The CDC adds, "It is important to remember that BMI is only one factor related to risk for disease," and that other predictors, such as waist circumference and levels of blood pressure and physical activity, are also important.

The 1997 Field Representative's Manual describes work loss day as missing more than one-half of the usual work day from a job or business because of illness or injury.  Interviewers were instructed to "always probe for an exact number. If the sample adult reports a range or interval, assist the sample adult in making an estimate by probing. For example, you might ask 'Could you give me a more exact number?'"

      <labl>Kind of usual place for medical care</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[TYPPLSICK reports the type of place respondents usually go to when they are sick or need advice about their health. (Responses were collected only if respondents acknowledged having one or more usual places to go when sick, as reported in USUALPL.)

If there was a "yes" response to the question about whether there is a place that the person usually goes when sick, interviewers asked, "What kind of place is it--a clinic, doctor's office, emergency room, or some other place?" If the response to the question was "there is more than one place," interviewers asked, "What kind of place do you go to most often--a clinic, doctor's office, emergency room, or some other place?"

Definitions

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 states, "A place to USUALLY go when sick or in need of advice about one's health includes: Walk-in clinic, Doctor's office, Clinic, Health Center, Health Maintenance Organization, Hospital - Emergency room or outpatient clinic, Military or VA health care facility." The survey form recognized a smaller number of options: "Clinic or health center"; "Doctor's office or HMO"; "Hospital Emergency Room"; "Hospital outpatient department"; and "Some other place."

The Manual for 1995-2000 provided directions on distinguishing between a doctor's office and a clinic or health center. If the respondent used the term "clinic" or "health center," the interviewer was to record this. However, if the respondent was unable to classify the place as a doctor's office, clinic or health center, the interviewer was instructed to probe to determine how many doctors work out of the "place." A "place" with 3 or less doctors was to be considered a doctor's office.


Related Variables


Interviewers also asked whether persons usually go to the same place identified in TYPPLSICK for their routine or preventive care (ROUTCARE) and, if not, the type of place where the person normally receives routine preventive care (PLACECAR). Other questions covered whether the person has changed the usual place of health care in the past twelve months, (if so) whether this change was for reason related to health insurance, and (in 1999) how long subject had been going to their usual source of health care and why some persons lacked a usual source of care.

      <labl>Goes to same place for routine care as for sick care</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ROUTCARE indicates whether the place sample adults and sample children usually went for routine or preventive care was the same place they usually went to when sick or when they needed advice about their health (see also USUALPL).  As examples of routine care, the question for sample adults mentioned "a physical examination or checkup"; the question for sample children mentioned "a physical examination or well baby/child check-ups."  

The Field Representative's Manual defined "routine or preventive care" as "a health procedure or series of health procedures done to help a person avoid illness or to detect problems early" (for 1997) or as "a doctor visit or health procedure to prevent illness or to detect problems early, such as immunization or a physical exam" (for 1998 forward).

The Manual consistently defined "a general physical exam or check-up" as "an examination not for a specific condition or problem. This may include the following: a periodic health examination, a complete medical examination, an annual health check-up or a comprehensive physical examination. It does NOT include dental exams and vision tests." These definitions were not routinely shared with respondents.]]></txt>

      <labl>Medical care delayed due to cost, past 12 months</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[DELAYCOST indicates whether, during the past twelve months, individuals delayed seeking medical care because of worry about the cost.  For 1997 forward, respondents were told not to include dental care when answering this question.

 The Field Representative's Manual for 1993 forward noted, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."  This definition of the term was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables

Several other variables available for 1997 forward address reasons other than "worry about the cost" that caused sample adults and sample children to delay getting medical care.  The non-financial reasons for delays in getting medical care identified in these variables are:  "you couldn't get an appointment soon enough" (DELAYAPPT); "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you couldn't get through on the telephone" (DELAYPHONE); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

Available for 1997 forward, YBARCARE, which identifies individuals who needed but did not get medical care because they could not afford it during the past 12 months, covers some of the same ground as DELAYCOST.  However, the wording of the question for YBARCARE implies that medical care was foregone for financial reasons, while the wording of the question for DELAYCOST refers to care delayed for financial reasons.  The difference in these two variables may, however, be less than is implied by this semantic distinction.  In the case of some acute illnesses (such as respiratory infections and "stomach flu"), medical care that was delayed was doubtless ultimately foregone in many cases.

      <txt><![CDATA[PLACECAR reports where, if anywhere, the sample adult or sample child usually went "when you need routine or preventive care, such as a physical examination or check up."

Definitions

The Field Representative's Manual defined "routine or preventive care" as "a health procedure or series of health procedures done to help a person avoid illness or to detect problems early" (for 1997) or as "a doctor visit or health procedure to prevent illness or to detect problems early, such as immunization or a physical exam" (for 1998 forward).

The Manual consistently defined "a general physical exam or check-up" as "an examination not for a specific condition or problem. This may include the following: a periodic health examination, a complete medical examination, an annual health check-up or a comprehensive physical examination. It does NOT include dental exams and vision tests." These definitions were not routinely shared with respondents.


Data Collection

For both sample adults and sample children, the NHIS question associated with PLACECAR ("What kind of place [do/does] [you/sample child] usually go to when [you/sample child] need[s] routine preventive care, such as a physical examination or [well baby/child] check-up?") was asked only if specific criteria were satisfied.

The question was asked if any of the following criteria were satisfied:

(1) USUALPL (whether the sample adult or sample child had a place (or more than one place) that they usually went when they were sick or needed advice about their health) is not coded as either "Yes" (2), or "More than one place" (3).
(2) TYPPLSICK (the type of place sample adults and sample children usually went when they were sick or needed advice about their health) is coded as either "Unknown-Refused" (97), "Unknown-not ascertained" (98), or "Unknown-don't know" (99).
(3) ROUTCARE (whether the place that the sample adult and sample child usually went for routine or preventive care was the same place that they usually went when sick or when they needed advice about their health) is not coded as "Yes" (2).

However, because of the interrelationships between these variables, the question associated with PLACECAR is asked whenever ROUTCARE is not coded as "Yes" (i.e., the place where the sample adult/child usually went for routine or preventive care was not the same place where they usually went when sick or needed advice about their health).

DELAYAPPT is one of several variables identifying barriers to getting medical care promptly.

Have you delayed getting care for any of the following reasons in the past 12 months?"  Other (non-financial) reasons for delayed access to care identified in the survey are: "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you couldn't get through on the telephone" (DELAYPHONE); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

This series of questions was not intended to elicit instances when needed medical care was foregone entirely; the Field Representative's Manual states, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[DELAYPHONE identifies sample children and sample adults who had delayed getting medical care during the past 12 months because they "couldn't get through on the telephone."

DELAYPHONE is one of several variables identifying barriers to getting medical care.  Interviewers began the series of questions by saying, "There are many reasons people delay getting medical care.  Have you delayed getting care for any of the following reasons in the past 12 months?"  Other (non-financial) reasons for delayed access to care identified in the survey are: "you couldn't get an appointment soon enough" (DELAYAPPT); "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

This series of questions was not intended to elicit instances when needed medical care was foregone entirely; the Field Representative's Manual states, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."]]></txt>

The medication is usually obtained through a pharmacy using a written note or telephoned instruction" to the pharmacy from a doctor, dentist, or other health care professional. A similar definition was included in the 2004-2006 Manuals. These points in the documentation were not routinely shared with respondents.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPUBCOVE is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons, whether the individual had health insurance coverage through Medicaid, any other state or other local government program that pays for health care, or, for 1999 forward, the Children's Health Insurance Program. 

For all years, the period of coverage refers to at the time of the survey. The component variables used to construct it are: HIMCAIDE, HISTATEE , HICHIPE, and  HIOTHGOVE.  HIPUBCOV excludes military coverage ( HIMILITE), Medicare (HIMCAREE), and Indian Health Service coverage (HIHSE).

 
Data Collection

For 1997 forward, HIPUBCOVE is based on a direct question about what kind of insurance the person had. Respondents were shown a flashcard listing insurance types and told to pick which one(s) they (and their family members) had.

For 1997 forward, interviewers began by asking whether each family member had any kind of health insurance coverage. For 1997 to 1999, only persons with an affirmative response to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and details of coverage

For 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


Various definitions of Medicaid were provided to respondents, but the changes in the definition were not substantial.

In essence, for 1976 to 1996, Medicaid was defined as a health insurance program that provides medical assistance to persons in need. The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."


Survey Questions

The order and wording of NHIS questions on health insurance coverage changed over time to reflect the availability of different types of coverage and issues of interest. From 1976 to 1996, respondents were asked a series of questions on whether family members had each of several types of coverage. Starting in 1997, respondents selected the relevant types of coverage from a list on a flashcard. The contents of the flashcard list reflected the types of public programs available at the time. Users are encouraged to read the User Note on "Changes in the Insurance Data Collection Process" for further information.

The survey questions used to collect the information included in HIPUBCOV changed over time.


1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" For individuals who had an affirmative response, the interviewer asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a flashcard listing various types of insurance coverage, including Medicaid. The options on the card were as follows:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPRIVATEE indicates whether the person currently had private health insurance coverage. Private health care plans may be provided in part or in full by an individual's employer or union, and they may also be purchased directly by a person.

HIPRIVATEE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included in the original NHIS public use data. HIPRIVATEE, like other recoded health insurance variables in these data, is based on responses to a series of questions and by editing carried out by the NCHS.

Definitions

The Field Representative's Manual for 1998 defines a private health insurance plan as "any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public programs in categories (4) and (6)-(11)" (of the flash card used by respondents in that year to report their type(s) of insurance coverage). In other words, private health insurance is, in the NCHS, defined as insurance other than Medicare, Medi-Gap, Medicaid, Military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, State-sponsored health plans, and health insurance from other government programs (including CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Plan, which was added to the card in 1999).

The flash card specified distinct kinds of private health insurance coverage in certain years: private health insurance plan from employer or workplace; Medi-Gap (i.e., private health insurance purchased to supplement Medicare), and private insurance plan through a state or local government program or community program. 

This last category, which was first added to the card in 1998, was defined in the Manual for that year as follows:

Private Health Insurance Plan through a State or Local Government program or community Program is a type of private insurance for which state or local government or community effort pays for part or all of the cost of a private insurance plan, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The individual may also contribute the cost of the health insurance and may receive a card such as a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card. A community program or effort may include a variety of mechanisms to achieve health insurance for persons who would otherwise be uninsured. An example would be a private company giving a grant to an HMO to pay health insurance coverage. (Beginning in 1999, the example changed to "a private company providing insurance for 500 uninsured children at little or no cost.")



Single service plans are another type of insurance usually classified as private health insurance, but single service plan coverage did not count as private insurance coverage in HIPRIVATEE. 


Single service insurance was first defined in the 1999 Field Representative's Manual as "health insurance coverage paid for by the individual that provides for only one type of service. Examples of SSPs are dental care, vision care, prescriptions, nursing home care, hospice care, accidents, catastrophic care, cancer treatment, AIDS care, and/or hospitalization."

Initially, the NHIS specifically directed respondents to exclude such private single service plans from their reports of private insurance coverage. In 1997-1998, the flashcard listing general types of insurance coverage and handed to respondents stated, "EXCLUDE private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized or pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, this policy changed. The category "Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions)" was added to the flash card, and the card directed respondents to "INCLUDE those that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care), exclude private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized."

While information on most kinds of single service plans was collected in the survey from 1999 forward, these privately purchased single service health insurance plans were not treated as "private insurance coverage" in HIPRIVATEE.  As the Field Representative's Manual for 2001 forward explained, "In trying to determine the appropriate type of health care coverage that an individual has, it is important to remember that for purposes of this survey, Single Service Plans are not considered private health insurance and should not be recorded as such. For individuals who indicate that they are covered by a Single Service Plan, simply record them as being covered by a single service plan, and the appropriate follow up questions will be asked."


2001 marked the first year that the Field Representative's Manual provided guidance to interviewers on recording responses relating to two other types of private insurance coverage--COBRA and TCC--that were included in HIPRIVATEE (under the subheading, "Private Health Insurance Plan from employer or workplace").

 The Manual's discussion of COBRA and TCC was as follows:

If a respondent indicates that he/she is covered by COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by TTC (Temporary Consolidation of Coverage), this should be coded as a Private Health Insurance Plan from employer or workplace. COBRA provides a bridge between health plans for qualified workers, their spouses and their dependent children when their health insurance might otherwise be cut off. Under this act, if a person voluntarily resigns from a job or is terminated for any reason other than 'gross misconduct' they are guaranteed the right to continue in their former employers group health insurance plan as an individual or family health care coverage for up to 18 months at one's own expense. In some cases, a spouse and dependent children are also eligible for COBRA coverage for as long as three years.

The TCC program is similar to COBRA. This program is available to federal employees. If a person loses Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) coverage because of separation from federal service, they may enroll under the TCC provision of FEHB law to continue coverage for up to 18 months at their own expense in a FEHB plan. Family members who lose coverage because they are no longer eligible may enroll under TCC to continue FEHB coverage for up to 36 months at their own expense.


Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills." In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."

Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

The categories listed were:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)



Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Instructions regarding single service plans changed over time. 

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized." In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."


Follow-up questions were used to collect information about plan names and to verify non-coverage. 

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.

Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, such as HIPRIVATEE, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Related Variables

In addition to HIPRIVATEE, IPUMS NHIS contains other  recoded insurance variables.

These are: HIHSE (Covered by Indian Health Service: Recode); HIMILITE (Covered by military health insurance: Recode); HIMILITE (Covered by military health insurance: Recode); HIMCAIDE (Covered by Medicaid: Recode); HIMCAREE (Covered by Medicare: Recode); HISTATEE (Covered by other state-sponsored health plan: Recode); HIOTHGOVE (Covered by other government program: Recode); and HINOTCOVE (No coverage of any type: Recode).

      <txt><![CDATA[HIMILITE indicates whether the person currently had health insurance coverage through some form of military health insurance. For those with military health insurance, HIMILITE distinguishes between those who had: 1) Military or VA health insurance only; 2) those who had CHAMPUS, TRICARE, or CHAMP-VA coverage only; 3) those with military health insurance coverage from both of these groups; and 4) those who had military health insurance of an unspecified type.

Definitions of Types of Military Health Insurance


Military Health Care provides medical care on military bases to current armed forces members and their dependents. Medical care from the VA is available to honorably discharged veterans who either have a service connected illness, injury, or disability, or whose incomes are near or below poverty. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2003 provided the following definition for this first set of military health care programs: "Military health care/VA refers to health care available to active duty personnel and their dependents; in addition, the VA provides medical assistance to veterans of the Armed Forces, particularly those with service-connected ailments."

The Civilian Health and Medical Program Uniform Service of the Department of Defense (CHAMPUS) is a health care benefits program that provides in-patient and out-patient care from civilian sources and Military Treatment Facilities, on a cost sharing basis. In the late 1990s, a managed care approach was phased in, under the name TRICARE. Retired members of the military are eligible for such coverage, as are the dependents of active-duty, retired, and deceased military.

The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a health benefits program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs shares the cost of health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. Persons eligible for TRICARE/CHAMPUS are not eligible for CHAMPVA coverage. Persons potentially eligible for CHAMPVA coverage are: the spouse or child of a veteran who has been rated permanently and totally disabled for a service-connected disability by the VA; the surviving spouse or child of a veteran who died from a VA-rated service connected disability; the surviving spouse or child of a veteran who was at the time of death rated permanently and totally disabled; or the surviving spouse or child of a military member who died in the line of duty.

The Field Representative's Manual provided two definitions for this second set of military health care programs. For 1997-2000, the Manual stated, "CHAMPUS (Comprehensive Health and Medical Plan for the Uniformed Services) provides health care in private facilities for dependents of military personnel on active duty or retired for reasons other than disability. TRICARE is the 'managed care' version of CHAMPUS. CHAMP-VA (Comprehensive Health and Medical Plan of the Veterans Administration) provides health care for the spouse, dependents, or survivors of a veteran who has a total, permanent service-connected disability." The definition in the Manual for 2001 was more extensive:

TRICARE is a regionally managed health care program for active duty and retired members of the uniformed services, their families, and survivors. Under TRICARE, there are three options for health care: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Standard. CHAMPUS (Comprehensive Health and Medical Plan for the Uniformed Services) is an older name which is used sometimes. CHAMPUS is now called TRICARE Standard. CHAMP-VA (Comprehensive Health and Medical Plan of the Veterans Administration) provides health care for the spouse, dependents, or survivors of a veteran who has a total permanent service-connnected disability.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. 

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.


Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, such as HIMILITE, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Related Variables

In addition to HIMILITE, IPUMS NHIS contains the following recoded insurance variables: HIHSE (Covered by Indian Health Service: Recode); HIPRIVATEE (Covered by private health insurance: Recode); HICHIPE (Covered by Children's Health Insurance Program: Recode); HIMCAIDE (Covered by Medicaid: Recode); HIMCAREE (Covered by Medicare: Recode); HISTATEE (Covered by other state-sponsored health plan: Recode); and HIOTHGOVE (Covered by other government program: Recode).

      <txt><![CDATA[HIOTHGOVE indicates, from 1997 forward, whether the person currently has health care coverage provided by a public program at the time of the interview other than Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP/SCHIP (1999 forward), Military health care/VA, TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, or a State- sponsored public health insurance plan. 

In 1992, this variable refers to insurance coverage during the month prior to the interview. All missing data in 1992 were imputed by the NHIS. Please refer to HIOTHGOVEFL to identify persons with imputed data.

HIOTHGOVE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included in the original NHIS public use data. HIOTHGOVE, like other recoded health insurance variables in these data, is based on responses to a series of questions and editing carried out by the NCHS.

Definitions

According to the Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward, the expression "Other Government Program" is a "catch-all category for any public program providing health care other than those" already categorized. More specifically, "other government program" refers to public health insurance coverage from a source other than the following: Medicare (HIMCAREE); Medicaid (HIMCAIDE); Children's Health Insurance Program (HICHIPE); military health insurance (including Military Health Care/VA and TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA) (HIMILITE); Indian Health Service (HIHSE); and State-sponsored public health care coverage plans (HISTATEE).

Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?"

Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills." In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."


Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

Choices included:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)


Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," while the treatment of single service plans varied by year.

 In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."


Follow-up questions collected information about the names of coverage plans and confirmed the lack of any type of coverage for the uninsured.

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had.

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.


Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, such as HIOTHGOVE, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

      <txt><![CDATA[HISTATEE indicates whether a person currently had health insurance coverage from a State-sponsored health plan. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined this type of insurance plan as "any other health care coverage run by a specific state, including public assistance programs other than 'Medicaid' that pay for health care."

The "other" in the HISTATEE definition must be interpreted as "other than" the state health care coverage plans identified in their own recoded variables in IPUMS NHIS.

HIMCAIDE (Covered by Medicaid: Recode) identifies persons who have insurance coverage through Medicaid, a state- and federally-funded program administered by state agencies. Medicaid pays for medical care for low-income families with dependent children and for aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals with incomes insufficient to meet the costs of medical care. HICHIPE (Covered by Children's Health Insurance Program: Recode) also refers to a state-administered program, which in this case uses federal funds to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured low-income children.


The names of the health care programs run by states differed from state to state, so interviewers were supplied with cards listing "State Names for Medicaid, CHIP, State-/Local-Sponsored, and Other Health Insurance Programs." These linked broad categories of insurance that were studied in the survey to recognizable public health insurance program names. For example, one of the State-sponsored health plans in place in Arkansas in 1999 was the "Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan."

HISTATEE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included in the original NHIS public use data. HISTATEE, like other recoded health insurance variables in these data, is based on responses to a series of questions and by editing carried out by the NCHS.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIMCAIDE indicates whether the person currently had health insurance coverage through Medicaid.

Medicaid pays for medical assistance to low-income families with dependent children and to aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals with incomes insufficient to meet the costs of medical services.

The program became law in 1965. Medicaid is administered by state agencies and is jointly funded by the federal, state, and, sometimes, local governments. Eligibility requirements for this means-tested program vary across states. Most recipients of public welfare income programs such as TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) and SSI (Supplemental Security Income) are eligible for Medicaid coverage. In some states, other persons qualify, such as needy unemployed persons who have children and who are not receiving cash assistance, and medically needy persons whose income and assets are too low to cover their medical costs. Many Medicaid recipients are inmates of medical institutions, such as low-income elderly persons in nursing homes. Such institutionalized persons are not included in the NHIS sample, which covers the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States.


The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."

As the Manuals noted, the name for the Medicaid program varies across states. Interviewers were supplied with cards listing "State Names for Medicaid, CHIP, State-/Local-Sponsored, and Other Health Insurance Programs" in their state.

These linked broad categories of insurance that were studied in the survey to recognizable public health insurance program names. For example, in 1999, the California Medicaid program was called the "Medi-Cal" or "Medi-Cal Managed Care" or "The Two-Plan Model."


HIMCAIDE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and was included in the original NHIS public use data.

Medicare provides health coverage to almost all Americans aged 65 or older. Disabled persons who received cash benefits for 24 months under the Social Security program and persons suffering from end-stage renal disease also have Medicare coverage.

Medicare's Basic Hospital Insurance Plan pays for hospital costs and post-hospitalization services. The Medical Insurance Plan is a voluntary plan covering physicians' services and a variety of medical and health services received either inside or outside hospitals. This second part of Medicare is financed by monthly premium payments and subsidies from federal funds.


The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined Medicare as "the federal health insurance coverage for persons age 65+ years of age and certain disabled persons under age 65."

HIMCAREE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] and is included in the original NHIS public use data.

The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had.

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.


Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, such as HIMCAREE, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Related Variables

In addition to HIMCAREE, IPUMS NHIS contains the following recoded insurance variables: HICHIPE [Covered by Children's Health Insurance Program: Recode]; HIPRIVATEE [Covered by private health insurance: Recode]; HIMILITE [Covered by military health insurance: Recode]; HIHSE [Covered by Indian Health Service: Recode]; HIMCAIDE [Covered by Medicaid: Recode]; HISTATEE [Covered by other state-sponsored health plan: Recode]; and HIOTHGOVE [Covered by other government program: Recode].

      <txt><![CDATA[HIHSE indicates whether the person currently had health insurance coverage through the Indian Health Service (IHS).  

The Indian Health Service provides medical assistance to eligible American Indians at IHS facilities and helps pay the cost of selected health care services from other facilities.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined the Indian Health Service as "the Federal health care program for Native Americans."  

In Health, United States, an annual report on the health status of the nation submitted by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to the President and Congress, persons with only Indian Health Service coverage are considered uninsured.

HIHSE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included in the original NHIS public use data.   HIHSE, like other recoded health insurance variables in these data, is based on responses to a series of questions and by editing carried out by the NCHS.

      <txt><![CDATA[HINOTCOV is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff that indicates, for all persons, whether the individual had any general health insurance coverage.  Uninsured persons include those without any private insurance, or without public health insurance coverage through Medicaid, Medicare, military health care (1976 forward), Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (1999 forward), or a state-sponsored or other government program (1997 forward).  Persons covered only by a private plan that paid for one type of service, such as accidents or dental care, are also considered uninsured.  Persons covered only by the Indian Health Service (1993 forward) are coded as having no health insurance.  

For most years, HINOTCOV refers to a current lack of insurance coverage; for 1990 to 1996, the variable refers coverage status during the previous month. 

Methods of Determining Lack of Insurance

The process used to ascertain the lack of insurance coverage reported in HINOTCOV changed over time.  A brief description is provided below, while further information on the data collection process appears in the User Note on "Changes in Insurance Data Collection."


For 1976 to 1999, lack of health insurance was ascertained indirectly.  In other words, having no coverage was inferred from responses to a series of questions on various forms of coverage.  Interviewers asked about coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or other public assistance programs, military health care, and private insurance.  Persons not covered by any of these types of insurance were coded as having no health insurance.

For 1980 to 1996, persons who received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) were assumed to have health insurance coverage, since they were eligible for health care coverage (i.e., Medicaid) through these programs.

For 2000 forward, HINOTCOV reflects a response of "no coverage of any kind" to a direct question about what type of insurance the person had.


Survey questions

The specific questions used to determine coverage status changed over time. 


These questions are as follows:

1997 forward:

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPUBCOV is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons, whether the individual was covered by a public health insurance program. For all years except 1990-1996, HIPUBCOV refers to coverage at the time of the survey; for 1990-1996, the variable refers to coverage in the past month.

Variable Meaning

HIPUBCOV indicates whether the person had health insurance coverage through Medicaid, any other state or other local government program that pays for health care, or, for 1999 forward, the Children's Health Insurance Program. For 1980 to 1996, HIPUBCOV also includes those who received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), because persons in those programs were automatically enrolled in Medicaid. HIPUBCOV does not indicate coverage through any military health care program (see HIMILANY), Medicare (see HIMCARE) or the Indian Health Service (see HIHSE).

Data Collection

For 1976 to 1996, HIPUBCOV reflects responses to questions about whether the person had insurance coverage through Medicaid or some other public assistance program. For 1976 and 1980, HIPUBCOV is also based on responses to a question about why the person did not have private health insurance or Medicare coverage (see HINORMCAID). For 1980 to 1989, those who reported having a Medicaid card (including those whose cards may have been expired) were given an affirmative response in HIPUBCOV. For 1997 forward, HIPUBCOV is based on a direct question about what kind of insurance the person had. Respondents were shown a flashcard listing insurance types and told to pick which one(s) they (and their family members) had.

For 1997 forward, interviewers began by asking whether each family member had any kind of health insurance coverage. For 1997 to 1999, only persons with an affirmative response to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and details of coverage

For 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


Various definitions of Medicaid were provided to respondents, but the changes in the definition were not substantial.

In essence, for 1976 to 1996, Medicaid was defined as a health insurance program that provides medical assistance to persons in need. The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."


Survey Questions

The order and wording of NHIS questions on health insurance coverage changed over time to reflect the availability of different types of coverage and issues of interest. From 1976 to 1996, respondents were asked a series of questions on whether family members had each of several types of coverage. Starting in 1997, respondents selected the relevant types of coverage from a list on a flashcard. The contents of the flashcard list reflected the types of public programs available at the time. Users are encouraged to read the User Note on "Changes in the Insurance Data Collection Process" for further information.

The survey questions used to collect the information included in HIPUBCOV changed over time.


1976
For 1976, HIPUBCOV indicates Medicaid coverage or welfare received, with the information ascertained indirectly from responses about the person's reasons for not having private insurance or Medicare. Such indirect measurement of public coverage tends to be less accurate than direct questions about coverage, with a bias towards fewer affirmative responses for public coverage.
Which of these statements (Hand card) best describes why -- is not covered by any (private) health insurance plan? Any other reasons? Response categories:  Care received through Medicaid or Welfare

1980, 1982-1984,1986, 1989
For these years, coverage is indicated by receipt of welfare (AFDC or SSI) and by persons reporting having a Medicaid card. Interviewers read a definition of Medicaid ("There is a program called Medicaid that pays for health care for persons in need"), then asked if any family member had a Medicaid card. If the response was affirmative, the interviewer asked to see the Medicaid card to verify coverage.
Does anyone in the family now receive assistance through the "Aid to Families with Dependent Children" program, sometimes called "AFDC" or "ADC"?
Does anyone in the family now receive the "Supplemental Security Income" or "SSI"?
Does anyone in the family now have a Medicaid {or (name)} card? 

In addition, the following questions were asked in these survey years:
1980
Which of those statements describes why -- is not covered by any health insurance plan? Any other reason? Response categories:  Care received through Medicaid or Welfare. 

1982-1984,1986, 1989
Is anyone in the family now covered by any other public assistance program that pays for health care? 

1990-1992
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by Medicaid or (local name)? 
Did -- receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, sometimes called AFDC or ADC, or some other type of assistance payments in (month)? 
1992 only
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by any OTHER public assistance program (other than Medicaid) that pays for health care? 
In (month), did anyone in the family receive public assistance or welfare payments from the state or local welfare office? 

1993 to 1996
For 1993 to 1996, interviewers read a description of Medicaid to respondents and then asked the following questions:
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by Medicaid? 
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by any OTHER public assistance program (other than Medicaid) that pays for health care? Do NOT include use of public or free clinics if that is the only source of care. 
In (month), did anyone in the family receive public assistance or welfare payments from the state or local welfare office? 
In (month), did anyone in the family receive Supplemental Security Income or SSI? 
Did -- receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, sometimes called AFDC or ADC, or some other type of assistance payments in (month)? 

1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" For individuals who had an affirmative response, the interviewer asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a flashcard listing various types of insurance coverage, including Medicaid. The options on the card were as follows:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, HIPRIVATE is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates whether the person was covered by a comprehensive private health insurance plan.  For all years, those with single service plans only (i.e., those that paid for one type of care, such as nursing home care, accidents, or dental care) are not considered to have private health insurance.  However, private plans that pay extra cash while hospitalized were considered to be health insurance until 1989.

For all years except 1990-1996, insurance coverage refers to coverage at the time of the survey; for 1990-1996, the reference period is the previous month.

Changing Definition of Private Health Insurance

Along with changes in question order and wording, the definition of private insurance changed over time, to reflect the changes in the availability of different types of private coverage and issues of interest. Users are strongly encouraged to review these changes in the User Notes " Changes in Insurance Data Collection" and "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance". A summary of such changes is provided below.


For 1976-1989, plans that only provide extra cash while the person was hospitalized were considered to be health insurance. However, the Field Representative's Manuals for these years instructed interviewers to exclude other forms of single service plans, such as "[those covering] dread diseases (cancer, polio), plans that pay only for accidents, plans that pay only for dental bills, [and] "income maintenance" (which pay a fixed amount both in and out of the hospital). Interviewers were also instructed to exclude public programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, public welfare, "Crippled Children's Program," care given to military personnel, and veterans' benefits.

For 1976 to 1992, the survey questions on private insurance asked about coverage for hospital, surgeon or doctor's bills. For 1986 and 1989, the question also included coverage for dentists' bills. The1986 Manual defined dental coverage as "any insurance which pays all or part of a dentist's bill for any dental services other than oral surgery." The 1989 and 1992 Manuals noted that dental coverage had to be part of a comprehensive plan, and not a single service plan, to count. For 1989 and 1992, single service plans were not considered to be private health insurance.

For 1993 to 1996,  the Manuals instructed interviewers to consider single service plans as a form of private health insurance.

For 1997 forward, private health care plans are any insurance other than public programs. Such plans may be provided in part or in full by an individual's employer or union, and they may also be purchased directly. For 1997 forward, respondents were asked what kind of health insurance they had and shown a flashcard that listed types of insurance coverage. Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Beginning in 2004, the Field Representative's Manuals instructed interviewers to treat COBRA and TCC coverage as private insurance. The Manuals discussion of COBRA and TCC was as follows:

If a respondent indicates that he/she is covered by COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by TCC (Temporary Consolidation of Coverage), this should be coded as a Private Health Insurance Plan from employer or workplace. COBRA provides a bridge between health plans for qualified workers, their spouses and their dependent children when their health insurance might otherwise be cut off. Under this act, if a person voluntarily resigns from a job or is terminated for any reason other than 'gross misconduct,' they are guaranteed the right to continue in their former employer's group health insurance plan as an individual or family health care coverage for up to 18 months at one's own expense. In some cases, a spouse and dependent children are also eligible for COBRA coverage for as long as three years.

The TCC program is similar to COBRA. This program is available to federal employees. If a person loses Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) coverage because of separation from federal service, they may enroll under the TCC provision of FEHB law to continue coverage for up to 18 months at their own expense in a FEHB plan. Family members who lose coverage because they are no longer eligible may enroll under TCC to continue FEHB coverage for up to 36 months at their own expense.


Survey Questions

The survey questions collecting information about private insurance coverage changed over time.


1976, 1980
Is anyone in the family covered by hospital insurance, that is, a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital bill? 
Is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 

1980, 1982-1984,1986,1989
 (Not counting Medicare) is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
1986, 1989: or dentist bills, dental bills
1989: Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service such as nursing home care or accidents.

1990-1991
 Health insurance can also be obtained privately or through a current or former employer or union. Was anyone in the family covered by private health insurance or by membership in a health maintenance organization in (month)? 

1992
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service, such as nursing home care or accidents. 

1993-1996
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? 

1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" Individuals who had an affirmative response were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents were handed a flashcard that listed various insurance types and told to mark all that applied; response categories for private insurance included:
Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)

For 1997 to 1999, only persons with an affirmative answer to the initial question about having insurance have responses to follow-up questions about the type of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").

      <txt><![CDATA[HISTATE indicates whether a person had health insurance coverage from a State-sponsored health plan. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined this type of insurance plan as "any other health care coverage run by a specific state, including public assistance programs other than Medicaid that pay for health care."

The names of the health care programs run by states differed from state to state. For 1999 forward, interviewers also supplied respondents with cards listing the state names for Medicaid, CHIP, State sponsored, and other government programs. 

HISTATE is different from HISTATEE in that it is not edited to reflect any errors in a person's report of insurance type. HISTATEE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) that has been edited for accuracy of coverage type based on plan name.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Respondents sometimes misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.  NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables, such as HISTATEE, which is the edited variable corresponding to HISTATE.  The NCHS strongly advises  analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

      <txt><![CDATA[HICHIP indicates whether the person had health insurance coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Field Representative's Manual for 1999 defined CHIP as "a joint federal and state program, administered by each State that offers health care coverage to low-income, uninsured children. This law was passed in 1997." The Manual for 2001 forward added that the program is for children under age 19 who are not currently eligible for Medicaid or covered by private health
insurance. CHIP programs have distinct names in many states. The state names for CHIP were listed on a flashcard shown to the respondent.

Data Editing and Recoding

HICHIP is not corrected for reporting errors. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type. The IPUMS NHIS provides the recoded insurance variable for HICHIP under HICHIPE.

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.

Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, the data are edited based on the verbatim names of insurance plans. HICHIP is not corrected for reporting errors. Analysis done by IHIS staff indicates that between 1999 to 2009, about 8 percent respondents either reported having CHIP but were found to be not covered by CHIP or reported they did not have CHIP but did have CHIP coverage, based on the plan name they provided.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, HIMILANY indicates whether the individual had military health care or coverage through the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA). For 1986 forward, HIMILANY includes persons who had coverage through TRICARE (or CHAMPUS), CHAMP-VA, or some other military insurance. For 1980 to 1989, HIMILANY also includes respondents who had a disability-related health benefit due to service in the Armed Forces. In addition, for 1980 and 1976, HIMILANY reflects the response "military dependent" to a question about the reason for not having private insurance or Medicare.

HIMILANY relates to any form of military health care coverage (apart from VA disability compensation). This variable is thus broader in scope than HICHAMPANY (which addresses military health coverage through CHAMPUS and CHAMP-VA) and HIMILVA (which refers to health care for military dependents through other programs).  It also includes responses for 1980 and 1976 of military coverage as reason for not having any other form of insurance.

For definitions of the various forms of military health coverage, as reported in the NHIS Field Representatives Manuals, see HICHAMPANY.

Survey Questions

There were changes over time in how information was collected on military health coverage.

One such change was in the treatment of people who did not have an affirmative response to an opening question about whether they had health insurance.

For 1997 forward, respondents were first asked if they (or anyone in the family) were covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan. For 1997 to 1999, only people who answered this initial question affirmatively have responses in the data to follow-up questions about their kind of health insurance and the details of their coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer "yes" are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


The wording of questions relating to military health coverage also changed.


1976
Respondents were asked, "Which of these statements describes why -- is not covered by any health insurance (or Medicare)? Those who responded "Military dependent, (CHAMPUS), veterans' benefits" were considered to be covered by military health care.

1982, 1984 1986, 1989
Interviewers asked about each of several types of military health care, including benefits from the Armed Forces or Veterans' Administration (1989), receipt of military retirement payments from any branch of the Armed Forces or a pension from the Veterans' Administration (excluding VA disability compensation), coverage by CHAMPUS (1986 and 1989), and coverage by CHAMP-VA or any other type of coverage for military dependents or survivors of military persons. They also asked whether the person had a disability related to military service and, if so, whether he or she received compensation from the Veterans' Administration.

1992
Interviewers asked whether anyone in the family was covered by military health care, CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, or the VA.

1993 to 1996
 Interviewers asked about coverage in the previous month by military health care, including armed forces retirement benefits, the VA, CHAMPUS or TRICARE (in 1995 and 1996), or CHAMP-VA. Follow-up questions clarified whether the care was via CHAMPUS, CHAMP-VA, or any other military health care.

1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" If the response was affirmative, they asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response(s) from a flashcard listing the following types of insurance coverage:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Military Health Care provides medical care on military bases to current armed forces members and their dependents. Medical care from the VA is available to honorably discharged veterans who either have a service-connected illness, injury, or disability, or whose incomes are near or below poverty.

Question Format for Military Health Care


For 1982 to 1996, interviewers first asked about coverage under CHAMPUS and CHAMP-VA. Then, to collect the information reported in HIMILVA, they asked about coverage by any other program that provides health care for military dependents or survivors of military persons.

For 1997 forward, interviewers handed out a flashcard that listed various types of insurance and asked respondents to identify their kind(s) of coverage. For 1997 to 2003, this list included separate categories for "Military health care/VA" and "TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA" coverage. Persons with an affirmative response in HIMILVA chose the category "Military health care/VA."

Beginning in 2004, the response categories on the flashcard changed, so all military health care categories were collapsed into one: "Military health care (TRICARE/VA/CHAMP-VA)." For persons who selected this category, interviewers asked a follow-up question about their type of military health care, with possible choices being TRICARE, VA, CHAMP-VA, or other military coverage. For 2004 forward, HIMILVA identifies those who chose "Has other military health care" and "Has Military health care/VA insurance."

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 to 2003 referred to military health care/VA as "health care available to active duty personnel and their dependents; in addition, the VA provides medical assistance to veterans of the Armed Forces, particularly those with service-connected ailments." For a description of the various types of Military Health Care, see HICHAMPANY.


Survey Questions

Wording of the questions about Military Health Care coverage changed over time.


1982, 1984 1986, 1989
To ascertain military coverage, questions in these years asked about each of several types of military health care, including benefits from the Armed Forces or Veterans' Administration (1989), receipt of military retirement payments from any branch of the Armed Forces or a pension from the Veterans' Administration (excluding VA disability compensation), coverage by CHAMPUS (1986 and 1989), coverage by CHAMP-VA, or any other type of coverage for military dependents or survivors of military personnel. Interviewers also asked about whether the person had a disability related to military service and whether they receive compensation from the Veterans' Administration.

For 1993 to 1996 interviewers asked about coverage in the previous month by military health care, including armed forces retirement benefits, the VA CHAMPUS or TRICARE (in 1995 and 1996), or CHAMP-VA. Interviewers then asked whether whether the care was either CHAMPUS or CHAMP-VA and other military health care.

For 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" Individuals who had an affirmative response were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a flashcard listing the following types of insurance coverage:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.


In 2000, another change in the question format occurred, relating to the treatment of people who did not initially report having insurance.

For 1997 forward, interviewers first asked whether the person was covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan, before asking about the details of private insurance coverage. For 1997 to 1999, only people with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about their kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not say "yes" are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").

      <txt><![CDATA[For all respondents, HIMCAID indicates whether the respondent had Medicaid coverage. For 1990 to 1996, it reflects coverage during the previous month. For 1997 forward, it reflects coverage at the time of the survey. 

Users who want to compare Medicaid coverage over time should review the variable description HIPUBCOV, which may more accurately capture all respondents who were covered by Medicaid.

Note that the universe changed between 1999 and 2000, although this should not affect affirmative responses for this variable. For 1997 to 1999, it reflects responses of all persons who already indicated they had some form of health insurance. For 2000 forward it reflects responses of all persons. 

Various definitions for Medicaid were provided to respondents over time, but the changes in definition were not substantial. Medicaid was generally defined as a health insurance program which provides medical care for persons in need. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."


Medicaid pays for medical assistance to low-income families with dependent children and to aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals with incomes insufficient to meet the costs of medical services. The program became law in 1965. Medicaid is administered by state agencies and is jointly funded by the federal, state, and, sometimes, local governments. Eligibility requirements for this means-tested program vary across states. Most recipients of public welfare income programs such as TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) and SSI (Supplemental Security Income) are eligible for Medicaid coverage. In some states, other persons qualify, such as needy unemployed persons who have children and who are not receiving cash assistance, and medically needy persons whose income and assets are too low to cover their medical costs. Many Medicaid recipients are residents of medical institutions, such as low-income elderly persons in nursing homes. Such institutionalized persons are not included in the NHIS sample, which covers the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the United States.

As the manuals noted, the name for the Medicaid program varies across states. Interviewers were supplied with cards listing "State Names for Medicaid, CHIP, State-/Local-Sponsored, and Other Health Insurance Programs" in their state. These linked broad categories of insurance that were studied in the survey to recognizable public health insurance program names. For example, in 1999, the California Medicaid program was called the "Medi-Cal" or "Medi-Cal Managed Care" or "The Two-Plan Model."

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons (only those 65 and older in 1976), HIMCARE indicates whether the person had Medicare coverage. It reflects the verbatim response to a question on whether the person (or family member) had Medicare (for 1976 to 1996) or what kind of insurance the respondent (or family member) had. It is not comparable with the recoded variable HIMCAREE, which reflects responses edited for accuracy by the NCHS. See the comparability tab for more details.

Note that the universe changed between 1999 and 2000, although this should not affect affirmative responses for this variable. For 1997 to 1999, it reflects responses of all persons who already indicated they had some form of health insurance. For 2000 forward it reflects responses of all persons. 

Various definitions for Medicare were provided to respondents over time, but the changes in definition were not substantial. Medicare was defined as a health insurance program for certain disabled persons and for persons age 65 years old and older.


Medicare provides health coverage to almost all Americans aged 65 or older. Disabled persons who received cash benefits for 24 months under the Social Security program and persons suffering from end-stage renal disease also qualify for Medicare coverage. Medicare's Basic Hospital Insurance Plan pays for hospital costs and post-hospitalization services. The Medical Insurance Plan is a voluntary plan covering physicians' services and a variety of medical and health services received either inside or outside hospitals. This second part of Medicare is financed by monthly premium payments and subsidies from federal funds

In 1976, Medicare coverage for persons under 65 was inferred from answers to questions for reasons why the person had no insurance (HINORMCARE, care received through Social Security Medicare).

      <labl>Has Medi-Gap insurance</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[HIMEDIGAP indicates whether a person has Medi-Gap (Medicare Supplement Insurance) policy. 

For 1997 to 1999, only people who were covered by any kind of health insurance were asked questions about the type of coverage (and are in the universe for HIMEDIGAP).  Beginning in 2000, persons could indicate "no insurance" but nonetheless received follow-up questions on insurance coverage.

Definition
Though no definition is provided to respondents, Medi-Gap is a term for insurance policies that are designed to cover the health care not covered by Medicare. 


Policy owners pay a monthly premium for this extra coverage. The plans offer standardized levels of coverage (set by the U.S. government) and are sold by private companies. Thus, although different insurance companies sell these policies, the benefits of each class of Medi-gap plan are always the same. However, the cost may vary by type of plan, and insurance companies are allowed to set their own prices and rules about eligibility.

According to Medicare.gov, some Medi-gap policies are used to cover prescription drugs. As of 2006, when the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage (Medicare Part D) went into effect, Medi-gap plans no longer offer prescription drug coverage. However, persons with a Medi-gap plans that covered prescriptions were allowed to keep this benefit.

      <txt><![CDATA[In all years, HIOTHGOV indicates whether the person had health insurance coverage through a public program other than Medicare or Medicaid. For 1997 forward, in addition to excluding Medicare and Medicaid, HIOTHGOV refers to public coverage other than a State-sponsored health care program, and for 1999 forward, also other than the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Over the years, the term "other" always referred to public insurance apart from the public programs already asked about in the survey. The question order and the specific programs included in the interview prior to the question on "other public program" changed over time.

Except for 1992-1996, HIOTHGOV refers to coverage at the time of the interview; for 1992-1996, HIOTHGOV refers to coverage in the previous month. 

Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] .

Survey questions

For 1982 to 1996, respondents were asked a series of questions about whether family members had each of several types of public assistance coverage. For 1997 forward, respondents could select "other government program" from a list of different types of coverage.

The specific questions used to determine coverage through some other government program changed over time.


1999 forward
What kind of health insurance or health care coverage {do/does} {you/subject's name} have? INCLUDE those that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care), exclude private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized. 
1997-1998
What kind of health insurance or health care coverage {do/does} {you/subject's name} have? EXCLUDE private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized or pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care). 
1993-1996
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by any OTHER public assistance program (other than Medicaid) that pays for health care? (Do NOT include use of public or free clinics if that is the ONLY source of care.)
1992
 (In (month), was anyone in the family covered by) any OTHER public assistance program, other than Medicaid, that pays for health care? 
1982-1984,1986,1989
Is anyone in the family now covered by any other public assistance program that pays for health care? 


For 1997 forward respondents were first asked if they (and each family member) were covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan.  For 1997 to 1999, only those with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the type of health insurance and the details of coverage.

 For 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


For years prior to 1997, the relevant questions for HIOTHGOV referred to "public assistance" programs.

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1982 through 1989 indicate that other public assistance programs include welfare which may provide health care benefits. For 1984 to 1989, interviewers were instructed not to include church-sponsored programs or "charitable foundations" (such as Shriner's Children's Hospitals or the American Cancer-Society), if this information was volunteered. The Manuals for 1992 to 1996 do not provide a specific definition of "other public assistance."


Prior to 1997, questions on coverage through military health care programs occurred after the question for HIOTHGOV.

As such, it is possible that respondents covered by such programs indicated a "yes" response for HIOTHGOV. Analysis by IPUMS NHIS staff indicates that a very small fraction of respondents who indicated coverage through HIOTHGOV were also covered by a military health care program. These persons may have had both types of coverage.


For 1997 forward, Field Representative's Manuals describe "other government program" as a "catch-all category for any public program providing health care other than those" already categorized.

In other words, HIOTHGOV for 1997 forward refers to some government program other than Medicare, Medi-gap, Medicaid, SCHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program), Military health care, Indian Health Service, or a State sponsored health plan.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons (or persons covered by some kind of health care plan for 1997-1999), HINDIAN reports whether the respondent had Indian Health Insurance coverage at the time of the interview.   The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical assistance to eligible American Indians at IHS facilities and helps pay the cost of selected health care services from other facilities. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined the Indian Health Service as "the Federal health care program for Native Americans." 

Persons with only Indian Health Service coverage are considered to be uninsured, and included in the frequencies in the variable HINOTCOVE.

Data Collection Process

1997 forward interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" and individuals who had an affirmative responses were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a state or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)

State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, HISINGLE indicates whether the person currently had a single health insurance plan, such as a plan for dental, vision, or prescriptions. Respondents were asked what kind of health insurance they had and shown a flash card which listed different types of insurance coverage. Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Prior to 1999, single service plans were not considered a form of health insurance and respondents were asked to exclude such plans when responding to a question on whether they had insurance coverage.  This policy changed for 1999 forward, and the category of single service plan was added to the list of possible responses.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1999 described single service plans as:
"health insurance coverage paid for by the individual that provides for only one type of service. Examples of SSPs are dental care, vision care, prescriptions, nursing home care, hospice care, accidents, catastrophic care, cancer treatment, AIDS care, and/or hospitalization."

Users are strongly advised to review the variable, SINGLEE, a recoded variable indicating single service plan that has been edited by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).  

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The NCHS reassigned respondents to the appropriate category based on the plan name.

 The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type. 


 Related Variables


For 2004 forward, the survey included an additional probe question for all persons who indicated they were not covered by health insurance or did not indicate single service plan coverage. A
person who responded to either HISINGLE or SSPROB received the single service detail questions.
 SSPROB, Single service plan probe response

In follow-up questions, interviewers about the type of services provided; variables for these services are:
SSACCID, Single service plan for accidents
SSAIDS, Single service plan for AIDS care
SSCANCER, Single service plan for cancer treatment
SSCATAST, Single service plan for catastrophic care
SDENTALE, Single service plan for dental care
SSDISABL, Single service plan for disability insurance
SSDRUGS, Single service plan for prescriptions
SSHOSPIC, Single service plan for hospice care
SSHOSPIT, Single service plan for hospitalization only
 SSLONGT, Single service plan for long term care
SSVISION, Single service plan for vision care
 SSOTHER, Single service plan for other [type of care]

In 1989 and for 1999 forward, having such a single service plan did not count as having health insurance. For 1993 to 1996, by contrast, the NHIS recognized single service plans as a form of insurance coverage. In 1993-1996, persons who reported having any form of private insurance were asked for clarification of whether their plan paid for "a variety of health care services" (i.e., was comprehensive coverage) or "for only one type of service or care" (i.e., was a single service plan).

Users are strongly encouraged to review the user notes Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] and Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Related variables
For 1999 forward, the following variables reflect the type of single service plans available:
 SSAIDS: Single service plan for AIDS care
 SSCANCER:  Single service plan for cancer treatment 
 SSCATAST: Single service plan for catastrophic care 
 SDENTALE: Single service plan for dental care 
 SSDISABL: Single service plan for disability insurance 
 SSDRUGS: Single service plan for prescriptions 
 SSHOSPIC: Single service plan for hospice care
 SSHOSPIT: Single service plan for hospital care
 SSLONGT: Single service plan for long-term care 
 SSVISION: Single service plan for vision care
 SSOTHER: Single service plan for some other type of care 


Definition and Classification of Single Service Plans

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1989 and 1999 forward stated that single service plans were not a form of private comprehensive insurance.

The 1989 Manual defined single service plans ("specialty health care" plans) as "usually limited to one type of service and frequently obtained to supplement a comprehensive plan that may not provide that type of coverage." 1989 was the first year in which information on single service plans was collected, for the Manual noted they were a "relatively new concept." The 1989 Manual instructed interviewers not to include, among single service plans, those comprehensive plans that had additional benefits paid for in the premium payment. For example, "some comprehensive plans pay for prescriptions and this coverage is included in the premium payment. This service would be considered part of their comprehensive plan and not a single service." Interviewers could probe to determine whether a particular service was included in the respondent's comprehensive coverage.

For 1993 to 1996, respondents were asked whether they had any private insurance, including single service plans. If the answer was affirmative, they were then asked whether the plan paid for a variety of services (a comprehensive plan) or one type of service.


Survey Questions

The wording of questions about single service coverage changed over time.


1989
(In addition to the plan(s) you just mentioned) Is anyone in the family now covered by an insurance plan that pays for only one type of health care service, such as nursing home care, eye care, or prescriptions?

A different variable, HIPDENTCOVR, reports on coverage for dental bills through a comprehensive private health insurance plan.

Data Collection Process for SDENTAL


The 1989 NHIS Field Representative's Manual described "specialty health care plans" "that pay only for a specific health care service, such as prescriptions, cancer treatment, or eye care" as "a relatively new concept in health care insurance." The Manual further stated that such a plan "is usually limited to one type of service and is frequently obtained to supplement a comprehensive plan that may not provide that type of coverage." For 1993 forward, single service plans are defined as plans that pay for only type of service.

For all years, persons who reported having insurance that paid for only one type of care were asked what type of service was covered. For 1999, interviewers first asked an opening question about whether the person had some form of health insurance, and then asked only those with an affirmative response about single service coverage (including dental care). For 2000 forward, even persons who chose the category "no coverage of any type" in response to the opening question received the question for SDENTAL.

For further information about how the NHIS collected information about dental coverage, either as part of comprehensive plans or as single service plans, see the variable description for DENTALCOVR.

      <txt><![CDATA[For people with Medicare coverage, MCARETYP reports the type of Medicare coverage.

MCARETYP is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and is included in the original NHIS public use data. MCARETYP, like other recoded health insurance variables in the NHIS data, is based on responses to a series of questions and back editing carried out by the NCHS.

Definitions

People were asked their type of Medicare coverage only if they had Medicare coverage (HIMCAREE). The NCHS provides the following definition of "Medicare":

Medicare: Medicare "is a nationwide health insurance program providing health insurance protection to people 65 years of age and over, people entitled to social security disability payments for 2 years or more, and people with end-stage renal disease, regardless of income. The program was enacted July 30, 1965, as Title XVIII, Health Insurance for the Aged of the Social Security Act, and became effective on July 1, 1966. From its inception, it consists of two separate but coordinated programs, hospital insurance (Part A) and supplementary medical insurance (Part B).


For persons who responded affirmatively to having Medicare, interviewers were instructed to ask for their Medicare card. If the respondent was able to provide the card, interviewers were instructed to categorize the respondent's Medicare coverage as Part A, Part B, or both Part A and Part B. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides succinct characterizations of both Part A Medicare coverage and Part B Medicare coverage:


Part A Medicare Coverage: "Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Certain conditions must be met to get these benefits."
Part B Medicare Coverage: "Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary."


Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?"  

Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills."  In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."


Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?"  Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

 The choices included:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward) 
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)   


Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," and single service plans were also excluded.

In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."  Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans.  If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.


As already noted, people were asked their type of Medicare coverage only if they had already indicated that they had Medicare coverage.

Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. 

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on a card provided by the interviewer. 


Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, the data are back edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped.

Because of the errors in the respondents' original (unedited) answers to questions about insurance coverage, the NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers.

Only persons having an affirmative response to the recoded Medicare coverage variable, HIMCAREE, were included in the universe of MCARETYP.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPWORKR is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates whether insurance was obtained through an employer, union, or workplace. For all years except 1997 to 1999, the universe consists of persons with a private health insurance health plan. For 1997-1999, the universe is persons who had some form of health insurance. For 1995 forward, self-employed persons who obtained insurance through a professional association count as having insurance through the workplace.

Except for 1990-1996, HIPWORKR refers to coverage at the time of the interview; for 1990-1996, HIPWORKR refers to coverage in the previous month. 

For 1991 and 1990, HIWORKR is constructed from responses to HIWORK (private health insurance obtained through employer or union), which was released by the NCHS with no persons in the "unknown--don't know" category.

Number of Plans Considered

There were changes over time in the number of insurance plans considered when collecting information about how insurance was obtained.

Information was collected on "any plan" for 1976 and 1980; on to up to five plans in 1982; on up to six plans in 1983; on up to five plans for 1984-1989; on "any plan" for 1990 and 1991; and on up to four plans per family for 1992 forward. Beginning in 2004, the NHIS public use files reported data only for plans one and two.

The recoded HIPWORKR variable is based on responses to questions on coverage under plans one through five for 1982-1989, plans one through four for 1992-2003, and plans one and two for 2004 forward.  Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have little effect on the results for HIPWORKR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.


 Definition of Private Insurance

The definition of private insurance changed over time. Users are encouraged to review the User Note about "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance." The description below is an abbreviated version of the detailed information in that User Note.


For all years except 1993-1996, single service plans and plans that pay only for accidents were not considered to be health insurance.

For 1976 to 1989, plans that paid "extra cash" for hospital stays were considered to be health insurance, while for 1992 forward, they were not.

For 1993 to 1996 only, having just a single service plan was treated as having health insurance.

For 1999 forward, a separate category for single service plans was added to the flashcard listing types of insurance coverage, which further distinguished single service plans from comprehensive private health insurance.

For 1976 to 1989, the Field Representative's Manuals defined private insurance as "specifically designed to pay all or part of the hospital, doctor, surgeon, or other medical expenses of the insured individual" (including dentist expenses for 1989 and 1986). The Manuals further noted, "The plan, in order to be considered as insurance, must be a formal one with defined membership and benefits. Include Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Individual Practice Associations (IPAs), such as Kaiser, Group Health, etc."

For 1990 forward, the  Manuals defined private health insurance to be any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public programs of Medicare, Medicaid, Military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plans, CHIP (the Children's Health Insurance Plan, beginning in 1999), and health insurance from other government programs.

For 2001 forward, the Manuals indicated that insurance coverage through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by
TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage) should be considered private health insurance (obtained through an employer or workplace).


Survey questions

For all years, interviewers first asked whether respondents (and their family members) were covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan.

For 1997 to 1999, only people with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up question on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


The specific questions that were used to ascertain private insurance coverage through the workplace changed over time.


2004 forward: 
Which one of these categories best describes how this plan was obtained?
Response categories: Through employer; through union; Through workplace

1997-2003 forward: 
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, such as through a present or former employer or union? 

1993-1996
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? 
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, that is, through a present or former employer or union? 

1992
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service, such as nursing home care or accidents. 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union? 

1991
 Health insurance can also be obtained privately or through a current or former employer or union. Was anyone in the family covered by private health insurance or by membership in a health maintenance organization in (month)? 
 Was any of [name] health insurance obtained through an employer or union?

1982-1984,1986,1989
 (Not counting Medicare), is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
1986, 1989  or dentist bills, dental bills
1989: Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service such as nursing home care or accidents.
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, that is, through a present or former employer or union? 

1976, 1980 
Is anyone in the family covered by hospital insurance, that is, a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital bill? 
Is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union?

For 1997 to 1999, the universe includes those who mentioned they had some form of health insurance.

Number of Private Plans Considered

There were changes over time in the number of insurance plans considered when collecting information about private health insurance purchased directly.

Information was collected on "any plan" for 1976 and 1980; on to up to five plans in 1982; on up to six plans in 1983; on up to five plans for 1984-1989; on "any plan" for 1990 and 1991; and on up to four plans per family for 1992 forward. Beginning in 2004, the NHIS public use files reported data only for plans one and two.

The recoded HIPBUYOWNR variable is based on responses to questions on coverage under plans one through five for 1982-1989, plans one through four for 1992-2003, and plans one and two for 2004 forward.

Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have relatively little effect on the results for HIPBUYOWNR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans. For 2004 forward, information on third and fourth insurance plans is available only through the restricted access files available through Research Data Centers.


Users are strongly encouraged to review the user notes Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] and Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.]. 

Data Collection Process

For all years, interviewers first asked whether each family member was covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan. (Proxy reporting was allowed, so one person might provide this information for all family members.) Persons without an affirmative response to this opening query were treated differently beginning in 2000. 


For 1997 to 1999, only people with affirmative responses to this initial question were included in follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those without an affirmative response to the initial question are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or reporting "no insurance").


For 1976 to 1996, HIPBUYOWNR reflects a negative response indicating the plan was not obtained through an employer or union.

For these survey years, respondents were only asked a yes/no question about whether their private plan was obtained through an employer or union. Respondents who answered "no" were considered to have plans purchased directly. For 1995 forward, self-employed persons with insurance obtained through professional associations are included as having insurance through the workplace, not purchased directly.


For 1997 forward, respondents were handed a flashcard listing various types of health insurance and asked to pick which one(s) they had (or how the insurance was obtained, for 2004 forward). HIPBUYOWNR reflects the response category "purchased directly."

Survey Questions

The wording of questions used to ascertain whether private insurance was purchased directly changed over time.


1976, 1980 
Is anyone in the family covered by hospital insurance, that is, a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital bill? 
Is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union? 

1982-1984,1986,1989
 (Not counting Medicare) is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
1986, 1989: or dentist bills, dental bills
1989: Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service such as nursing home care or accidents.
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, that is, through present or former employer or union? 

1991
 Health insurance can also be obtained privately or through a current or former employer or union. Was anyone in the family covered by private health insurance or by membership in a health maintenance organization in (month)? 
 Was any of [name] health insurance obtained through an employer or union? 

1992

 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service, such as nursing home care or accidents. 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union? 

1993-1996
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? 
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, that is, through a present or former employer or union? 

1997 forward
What kind of health insurance or health care coverage {do/does} {you/subject name} have? INCLUDE those that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care), exclude private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized. Response category: Private health insurance plan purchased directly 

2004 forward: 
Which one of these categories best describes how this plan was obtained?
Response category: Purchased directly


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS staff discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Such errors became apparent, for example, through mismatches between the verbatim names of insurance plans and the type of insurance coverage people selected from categories on a flashcard. Users should be aware that the responses for HIPBUYOWNR prior to 1997 have not been edited for accuracy, and respondents may have mistakenly reported their insurance information.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPEMPAYR is a recoded variable, created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, that indicates whether the employer (or union) paid for any part of the expenses of a private health insurance plan. For all years except 1997 to 1999, the universe for this variable is all persons who reported having a private health insurance health plan that was obtained through an employer, union, or workplace. For 1997 to 1999, the universe includes all those who said they had some form of health insurance. For 1995 forward, self-employed persons and those who obtained insurance through professional associations count as having insurance acquired through the workplace. Except for 1990-1996, HIPEMPAYR
refers to coverage at the time of the interview; for 1990-1996, HIPEMPAYR
refers to coverage in the previous month.  

For 1991, HIPEMPAYR is constructed from responses to HIEMPLPAY (employer or union pays for all, part, or norm of the cost of plan), which was released by the NCHS with no persons in the "unknown--don't know" category.

The definition, order and wording of private health insurance changed over time to reflect changes in the availability of different types of coverage and issues of interest.  Users are strongly encouraged to review the user notes Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] and Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Number of Plans Considered

There were changes over time in the number of insurance plans considered when collecting information about the employer's (or union's) contribution.

Information was collected on "any plan" for 1976 and 1980; on to up to five plans in 1982; on up to six plans in 1983; on up to five plans for 1984-1989; on "any plan" for 1990 and 1991; and on up to four plans per family for 1992 forward. Beginning in 2004, the NHIS public use files reported data only for plans one and two.

HIPEMPAYR is based on responses to questions on coverage under plans one through five for 1982-1989, plans one through four for 1992-2003, and plans one and two for 2004 forward. Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have little effect on the results for HIPEMPAYR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.


Data Collection Process

For all years, interviewers first asked whether each family member was covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan. (Proxy reporting was allowed, so one person might provide this information for all family members.) Persons without an affirmative response to this opening query were treated differently in 1997-1999 than they were after 2000.

For 1997 to 1999, only people with affirmative responses to this initial question were included in follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those without an affirmative response to the initial question are coded NIU (not in in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or reporting "no insurance").


How data were collected on employer/union contributions to insurance costs changed over time. For 1989-1996, interviewers asked whether an employer or union paid for any part of the insurance premium.

If necessary, interviewers clarified the meaning of the question by stating, "The cost of the plan refers to the premiums, which are regular payments for health insurance coverage only, not for health care services. Frequently, these payments are made by payroll deduction."

For 1997 forward, interviewers asked, "Who pays for this plan?" and handed out a flash card that listed various responses. Respondents could pick all applicable responses.

Survey questions

The survey questions used to construct HIPEMPAYR changed over time.


These questions included the following:

1997 forward
Who pays for this health insurance plan?Response category: Employer or union 
1993-1996 forward
Does the employer or union currently pay for all, some, or none of the cost of premiums for this health insurance plan? Read if necessary: The cost of the plan refers to the premiums, which are regular payments for health insurance coverage only, not for health care services. Frequently, these payments are made by payroll deduction. 
1992
Does the employer or union pay for all, some, or none of the premium? 
1991
Did the employer or union pay for all, part, or none of the cost of this plan? 
1989
Does the employer or union pay for any part of the cost for this (name) plan? 


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS staff discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Such errors became apparent, for example, through mismatches between the verbatim names of insurance plans and the type of insurance coverage people selected from categories on a flashcard. Users should be aware that the responses for HIPEMPAYR prior to 1997 have not been edited for accuracy, and respondents may have mistakenly reported their insurance information.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPCAIDR is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons with at least one private health insurance health plan, whether they had at least one private plan that was paid for by Medicaid.

Rationale for Inquiry

Having a private plan paid for by the government program Medicaid may seem counter-intuitive. In fact, private insurance companies are allowed to administer portions of Medicaid benefits through Medicaid managed care arrangements in which health maintenance organizations contract directly with a state Medicaid agency to provide services on a capitated basis (fixed fee per enrollee). These managed care plans then enroll and provide services for Medicaid beneficiaries.

For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) published a listing of insurance plans contracting with Medicaid in each state in a 2009 report entitled, "2009 National Summary of State Medicaid Managed Care Programs." Users may want to review other documents from the CMS for further information on such payment arrangements.


Data Collection Process

Information was collected on up to four private plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data on plans one and two are publicly available. Therefore, for 1997 to 2003, HIPCAIDR indicates whether the person had any one of four plans paid for by Medicaid; for 2004 forward, it indicates whether the person had any of two plans paid for by Medicaid.

Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have little effect on the results for HIPCAIDR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.


For all years from 1997 forward, interviewers first asked whether the person was covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan.

For 1997 to 1999, only people with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about their kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not say "yes" are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics.  Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


Survey text

For each private insurance plan, respondents were asked "Who pays for this plan?" and were handed a card that listed various responses (including Medicaid). Respondents could pick all that applied.

Definition of Private Insurance


For 1997 forward, the NHIS Field Representative Manuals defined private health insurance to be any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public programs of Medicare, Medicaid, Military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plans, and health insurance from other government programs (including CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Plan, for 1999 forward).

For 2001 forward, the Manuals indicated that insurance coverage through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by
TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage) should be classified as private health insurance (obtained through an employer or workplace).

For 1997 forward, the definition of private insurance remained largely the same, and consistently excluded single service plans. Over a longer time span, the definition and data collection process for private insurance changed greatly (as is documented in the User Notes on "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance" and "Changes in the Data Collection Process").

Rationale for Inquiry

Having a private plan paid for by the government program Medicare may seem counter-intuitive.  Private insurance paid for by Medicare includes Medicare Private Fee-for-Service Plans, in which Medicare pays a set amount of money every month to the private insurance company, in order to provide health care coverage to people with Medicare on a fee-for-service basis. In such cases, the insurance company, rather than the Medicare Program, decides how much the individual pays for the services.  Users can find more information on such plans at Medicare program's website at www.medicare.gov.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPOGOVR is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons with at least one private health insurance plan, whether the plan was paid for by a state, local, or community program. If the person selected "state or local or community" program from the options on a flashcard list, interviewers probed to determine whether coverage was through or paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP before recording the "state or local or community" government program category.

Most private insurance plans paid for by public funding are through Medicaid, Medicare, or SCHIP (see HIPCAIDR, HIPCARER, HIPCHIPR). Private insurance paid for by a government program (other than by these sources) may include premium assistance programs, in which state or local governments supply a premium subsidy that allows individuals to purchase coverage on the private market, rather than receiving direct coverage through the state's program.

Number of Private Plans Considered

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data on plans one and two are publicly available. Therefore, for 1997 to 2003, this variable indicates whether the respondent had any one of four plans paid for by such a state government program; for 2004 and forward, it indicates whether the respondent had any of two plans paid for by such a program.

Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have relatively little effect on the results for HIPOGOVR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward).

Definition of Private Insurance

For 1997 forward, the Field Representative's Manuals defined private health insurance to be any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public insurance programs of Medicare, Medicaid, military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plans, and other government programs (including CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Plan, beginning in 1999).  

For 2001 forward, the Manuals indicated that insurance coverage through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by 
TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage) should also be considered private health insurance (obtained through an employer or workplace).

The definition of private insurance and the data collection process for insurance variables changed over time. (See the User Notes on "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance" and "Changes in the Data Collection Process for detailed discussion of these issues.) For 1997 forward, however, the data collection process and definition of private insurance remained largely the same (and consistently excluded single service plans).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPMDLISR is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff.  For persons with at least one comprehensive private health insurance plan for which they can choose any doctor (HIPMDPICR), HIPMDLISR indicates whether their plan provides the option of choosing a doctor from a preferred or select list at lower cost.  

Data Collection Process

While information was consistently collected on up to four private plans per family, data are publicly available only for plans one and two beginning in 2004. Changes in the number of plans considered should have little effect on the results for HIPMDLISR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.


For 1997 forward, interviewers first asked whether the person was covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan, before asking about the details of private insurance coverage.

For 1997 to 1999, only people with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about their kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not say "yes" are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


Survey text

In all years, the relevant survey question asked for each private plan was the following:

Do [you/the family member(s) with this plan] have the option of choosing a doctor from a preferred or select list at lower cost to you?

 Definition of Private Insurance

While the definition of private insurance changed over time, these changes did not affect the detailed questions about the characteristics of private comprehensive insurance plans (in variables like HIPMDLISR).

 If [you/family member] select a doctor who is not in the plan, will (plan name) pay for any part of the cost?

 Definition of Private Insurance

The definition of private insurance changed over time, as described in detail in the User Note on "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance."


For 1993 to 1996, single service plans counted as health insurance; however, only individuals with a plan that "pays for a variety of services" (as indicated, for example, by HI1VARSS) or a general purpose plan were asked the question for HIPMDOPR. For 1997 forward, the definition of private health insurance coverage excluded single service plans. This distinction between comprehensive and single service plans was further emphasized beginning in 1999, when a separate category for single service plans was added to the flashcard given respondents when they were asked to indicate their insurance type(s).


These various changes had little effect on responses for HIPMDOPR; consistently, only people with comprehensive private insurance were asked about payments to doctors on their plan's preferred list.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPTYPER is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons who had a general purpose private health insurance health plan, whether the plan was an HMO/IPA (Health Maintenance Organization or Individual Practice Association) or non-HMO/IPA.  

For 1997 forward, private insurance characteristics reported by the family respondent, including HMO and IPA status, were edited by the NCHS staff, based on the plan name. See the comparability section for more details.

Definition of HMO and IPA

For 1986 to 1996, the NHIS Field Representative's Manuals generally defined an HMO as a "health care plan that delivers comprehensive, coordinated medical services to enrolled members on a prepaid basis." (Prior to 1986, the  Manuals did not define an HMO.)  The Manuals further described listed three types of HMOs.

1) a Group/Staff HMO, which delivers services at one or more locations through a group of  physicians that contracts with the HMO to provide care or through its own physicians who are employees of  the HMO; 
2) an IPA, which makes contractual arrangements with doctors in the community, who treat HMO members out of their own offices;
3) a Network HMO, which contracts with two or more group practices to provide health services.  

The Manuals noted that "an HMO differs from other health insurance because it directly provides its members with most or all of their health care, while traditional health insurers simply process the claims.  An HMO assumes responsibility for providing the treatment as well as paying the bills."

For 1997 forward, the Manuals defined HMOs as "health delivery systems that offer comprehensive health coverage for hospital and physician services for a prepaid, fixed fee."


 Definition of Private Insurance

The definition of private insurance changed over time.  Users are encouraged to review the User Note on "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance."  The description below is an abbreviated version of the information provided in that User Note.


For 1976 to 1992, private health insurance excluded single service plans that paid for only one type of service (such as nursing home care, accidents, or dental care).  For 1976 to 1989, plans that paid extra cash while hospitalized counted as private insurance; such "extra cash plans" are not mentioned in the Manuals for 1992 and 1996.  

For 1993 to 1996, single service plans were considered to be health insurance; however, only respondents who indicated their plan was a general purpose plan were asked the question for HIPTYPER.  For 1997 and 1998, the definition of private insurance excluded single service plans. For 1999 forward, a separate category indicating single service plans was added to the survey, to better distinguish single service plans from comprehensive private health insurance.  

For 1976 to 1989, the general definition of private insurance in the Field Representative's Manuals referred to plans "specifically designed to pay all or part of the hospital, doctor, surgeon, or other medical expenses of the insured individual" (including dentist expenses for 1989 and 1986). The Manuals further stated, "The plan, in order to be considered as insurance, must be a formal one with defined membership and benefits.  Include Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Individual Practice Associations (IPAs), such as Kaiser, Group Health, etc."

For 1990 forward, the  Manuals defined private health insurance to be any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public programs of Medicare, Medicaid, Military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plans, CHIP (the Children's Health Insurance Plan, beginning in 1999), and health insurance from other government programs.


Survey Text

The questions used to collect information on HMO/IPA status of private insurance plans changed over time.


1997 forward
 Read If Necessary: Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs, and Individual Practice Associations, or IPAs, are plans whose members are required to use only those doctors who work for or in association with the plan. Sometimes members may choose to go to doctors not associated with the plan, but usually at greater cost to the member. Generally, members do not have to submit claims for costs of medical care services. 
Is {plan name} an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization), an IPA (Individual Practice Association), or is it some other kind of plan?

1993-1996
Read if necessary: Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMO's and Individual Practice Associations, or IPA's, are plans whose members are required to use only those health care providers who work for or in association with the HMO or IPA. Sometimes there is an option to permit use of providers not associated with the Plan, but usually at greater cost to the enrollee. Generally, members do not have to submit claims for costs of medical care services.
Is (plan name) an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) or IPA (Individual Practice Association), or is it some other kind of plan? 

1986,1989, 1992
 Read if necessary: Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMO's, sometimes called Individual Practice Associations or IPA's, are plans whose members are required to use only those health care providers who work for the HMO or IPA. Also, members do not have to submit claims costs of medical care services
Is this (name) plan a Health Maintenance Organization or HMO? 


Number of Plans Included

Information was collected on up to five private insurance plans per family between 1980 and 1989 and on up to four plans for 1992 forward. However, only data for plans one and two are publicly available for 2004 and later years. Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have little effect on the results for HIPTYPER.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.

Thus, throughout the period, HILAST is not asked of people who report having health insurance coverage via any of the following: private health insurance, including Medi-Gap; Medicare; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; Military health insurance (including Military Health Care/VA and TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA); Indian Health Service; State-sponsored public health care coverage plans; and other government programs.

For 2000 forward, HILAST is also asked of people reporting only single service plan coverage.


Use of HILAST

During the course of data editing, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. 

Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from categories on a card provided by the interviewer. Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped.


Because of the errors in respondents' original (unedited) answers to questions about insurance coverage, the NCHS warns that "the variables HILAST and HINOTYR, which reflect periods of non coverage, cannot be used to estimate the rate of uninsurance." Instead, the NCHS recommends using the health insurance recodes, estimating the rate of uninsurance as a residual. 

The relevant health insurance recodes in IPUMS NHIS are:

 
HIPRIVATEE (Covered by private health insurance: Recode);
HIHSE (Covered by Indian Health Service: Recode); HIMILITE (Covered by military health insurance: Recode); HIMCAIDE (Covered by Medicaid: Recode);
HIMCAREE (Covered by Medicare: Recode);
HICHIPE (Covered by Children's Health Insurance Program: Recode);
HISTATEE (Covered by other state-sponsored health plan: Recode);
HIOTHGOVE (Covered by other government program: Recode)
HINOTCOVE (No insurance coverage)

Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" 

Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills." In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."


Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

The choices included:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized." In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.


For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked, in sequence, whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage. Those who did not acknowledge any such coverage were asked the question associated with HILAST, namely, "When was the last time you had health care coverage?"

For 1997-1999, the NHIS instrument reconfirmed that the person had no health insurance of any kind by asking, "Just to verify, does [person] have Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program), CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA, or any private insurance?" If the answer was "no," then the respondent was asked the question associated with HILAST. However, for 2000 forward, this verification question was not asked.]]></txt>

Thus, throughout the period, HINOTYR is asked of people (specifically excluding armed forces members in 1997-1999) who report currently having health insurance coverage via any of the following: private health insurance, including Medi-Gap; Medicare; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; Military health insurance (including Military Health Care/VA and TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA); Indian Health Service; State-sponsored public health care coverage plans; and other government programs.

For 2000 forward, HINOTYR is not asked of people reporting only single service plan coverage.

According to the NCHS, HINOTYR should not be used to estimate the prevalence of uninsurance, due to data errors. 

During the course of data editing, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on a card provided by the interviewer.

Instead of using HINOTYR, researchers should using the health insurance recodes, estimating the rate of uninsurance as a residual, according to NCHS.

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," but the treatment of single service plans varied by year.

Follow-up questions collected information about the names of coverage plans and confirmed the lack of any type of coverage for the uninsured.

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans.

Thus, throughout the period, HINOTYRMO is asked of people (specifically excluding armed forces members in 1997-1998) if two criteria are satisfied:

The person reported currently having health insurance coverage via any of the following: private health insurance, including Medi-Gap; Medicare; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; Military health insurance (including Military Health Care/VA and TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA); Indian Health Service; State-sponsored public health care coverage plans; and other government programs.
The person responded affirmatively to HINOTYR, indicating that there was some point in the past 12 months at which he or she had no health insurance overage.

For 2000 forward, HINOTYRMO is not asked of people reporting only single service plan coverage.

To estimate the extent of uninsurance, the NCHS recommends using the health insurance recodes, estimating the rate of uninsurance as a residual. See the variable description for  HIPRIVATEE (Covered by private health insurance: Recode) for more details.

Users can also use HINOTCOVE, a recoded variable that indicates whether the person currently lacks health insurance coverage.

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private coverage. Except for 1993-1996, those who only had single service plans were classified as uninsured and included in the universe for this variable. For 1993-1996, the universe excludes those receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as recipients were eligible for health care through these programs.

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other"). Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only. The response categories listed on the card changed over time. For 1993-1996, HINOFAMR includes those selecting the responses "family coverage not offered by employer" and "too old for coverage under family plan"; for 1997, the response "spouse/parent lost job or changed employers"; for 1997 forward, the responses, "got divorced or separated/death of spouse or parent," and "ineligible because of age/left school"; and, beginning in 1998, the response "got married" as well.

      <txt><![CDATA[HINOAGER is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates whether the person did not currently have insurance coverage because he or she was no longer eligible for coverage under a parent's plan due to age (1993 forward) or to leaving school (1997 forward).  For 1993 to 1996, a lack of coverage referred to the previous month.

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private insurance. For 1993 to 1996 (but not for later years), those who had single services plans only and those who received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) were not considered uninsured.  

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other"). Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only.  The response categories listed on the card changed over time.  For 1993 to 1996, HINOAGER includes persons with the response "too old for coverage under family plans"(HINOROLD)."  For 1997 forward, it reflects the response "became ineligible because of age/left school (HISTOP4)."

Survey questions

The wording of questions used to collect information for HINOAGER differed between 1993-1996 and 1997 forward.

      <labl>Reasons for no insurance: Too expensive</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[HINOCOSTR is a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff, which indicates whether the person did not currently (except for 1993 to 1996 when coverage status referred to the previous month) have health insurance due to the expense or cost of insurance. 

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private insurance. Except for 1993-1996, those who only had single service plans were classified as uninsured and included in the universe for this variable.  For 1980-1996, the universe excludes those receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as recipients were eligible for health care through these programs. 

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other").  Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only.  The response categories listed on the card changed over time.  For 1976-1996, HINOCOSTR includes those selecting the response "too expensive, can't afford health insurance"; for 1997, it includes those who selected "insurance plan raised cost of premiums"; and for 1997 forward, it includes those who selected "cost is too high." 

Survey questions

The wording of questions about cost barriers to insurance coverage changed over time.

HINOCOSTR differs somewhat from other variables in the original NHIS public use files that relate to cost barriers to insurance coverage.

 
The related variables from the original NHIS public use files include:

 HINOREXPEN  (Reasons for no insurance: Too expensive)
HISTOP10A (Why coverage stopped: Insurance plan raised premium cost)
HISTOP11 (Why coverage stopped: Cost is too high)

HINOCOSTR excludes persons with health care coverage through public programs, such as Medicaid or Military health care, whereas the variables listed above include such individuals for some years. For example, for 1993 to 1996, individuals could respond that a reason for "no insurance" was coverage through a public program.  Unlike the original public use variables, HINCOSTR also excludes all those covered by AFDC or SSI, which improves comparability between earlier years and 1997 forward.

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private insurance. Except for 1993-1996, those who only had single service plans were classified as uninsured and included in the universe for this variable. For 1993-1996, the universe excludes those receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as recipients were eligible for health care through these programs.

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other"). Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only. The response categories listed on the card changed over time. For 1976-1996, HINOREFUSER includes those selecting the response "can't obtain because of poor health, illness, or age"; for 1997 forward, it includes those selecting "insurance company refused coverage."

Users may also want to review information about the component variables used to create HINOREFUSER.

Those variables are:

HINORPOORH (Reasons for no insurance: Can't obtain due to poor health/age) (1976 to 1996).
HISTOP12 (Why coverage stopped: Insurance company refused coverage) (1997 forward)


HINOREFUSER differs from these component variables in excluding persons covered by public insurance programs, and, for the period prior to 1997, excluding recipients of AFDC and SSI.

cost (HINOCOSTR)
family-related reasons (HINOFAMR)
being refused coverage (HINOREFUSER)

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private insurance. Except for 1993-1996, those who only had single service plans were classified as uninsured and included in the universe for this variable. For 1980-1996, the universe excludes those receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as recipients were eligible for health care through these programs.

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other"). Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only. The response categories listed on the card changed over time. For 1976 to 1996, HINOTHER includes those who selected the responses "have been healthy, not much sickness in the family, haven't needed health insurance," "dissatisfied with previous insurance," "don't believe in insurance," and "other"; for 1993-1996, also the response "free/inexpensive care available"; for 1997 forward, the response "some other reason"; and for 1998 forward, the responses "never had coverage," "no need/chooses not to have," and "moved from another county/state/country."

HINOTHER differs from variables in the original NHIS public use files that identify people who chose the reasons for lack of coverage that are included in HINOTHER.

These variables include:

HINORBELIEF Reasons for no insurance: Do not believe in insurance
HINORDISS  Reasons for no insurance: Dissatisfied with previous insurance
HINORHEAL Reasons for no insurance: Healthy/haven't needed
HINORFREE Reasons for no insurance: Free/inexpensive care available
HINOROTH Reasons for no insurance: Other
HISTOP16 Why coverage stopped: Never had coverage
HISTOP17 Why coverage stopped: Moved from another county/state/country
HISTOP19 Why coverage stopped: No need/chooses not to have
HISTOP22 Why coverage stopped: Other reason


HINOTHER differs from these related variables in excluding persons with health care coverage through public programs.

By contrast, the original NHIS variables included persons with public coverage in some years; for example, for 1993-1996, individuals could respond that a reason for "no insurance" was coverage through a public program. HINOTHER also excludes those receiving AFDC or SSI, who were eligible for public insurance through those programs.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who were covered by a private insurance plan that was paid for by the person or a family member living in the household, ("2" for HIP1SELF), this variable indicates the amount spent for insurance premiums, including payroll deductions. Respondents provided the amount in dollars spent on premiums (as a continuous measure) and the time period (month, week, etc). The IPUMS NHIS recode for HIP1COST also indicates whether the amount reported was more than $20,000 dollars (code "20000").

For 1999 to 2001, interviewers asked respondents for the amount paid on premiums in the past 12 months (e.g., "During the PAST 12 MONTHS, how much did {you/your family} spend for health insurance premiums for {plan name}?"). For 2002 forward, respondents were asked how much they (or their family} currently spend for health insurance premiums for each plan and could then specify the time period for the expenditure (e.g., once a week, a month or yearly). For 2002, responses were recoded to indicate annual expenditure.

In general, the definition and measurement of private health insurance for 1999 forward remained consistent. Single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the change in measurement of private insurance over time.

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The responses for HIP1COST reflect editing by NCHS to ensure that respondents do have private insurance. A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE.]]></txt>

      <labl>Plan 1: Doctor from preferred list</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For persons with at least one private health insurance plan for which they can choose any doctor ( HIP1MDPIC = 1), HIP1MDLIS indicates if the plan provides the option of choosing a doctor from a preferred or select list at a lower cost. For all years, persons with single service insurance plans (such as those which paid only for accidents) were not asked this question.

For 1993-1996, details about the characteristics of insurance plans (such as HIP1MDLIS) reflect plans for any family member in the household. In order to determine if the person (rather than someone else in the family) was covered by this plan, analysts should use the variable HI1PCOV (Health Insurance Plan 1: Person's Coverage Status), which indicates whether the person was covered by the plan.


Thus, information about whether the person had private insurance that was currently carried through an employer or union may appear in multiple variables: HI1EMP, through HI4EMP.  Likewise, the complementary variables HI1PCOV through  HI4PCOV indicate coverage status for the individual under each plan.


Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available.


Users may also want to see HIP2MDLIS, HIP3MDLIS and HIP4MDLIS. In addition, the IPUMS NHIS created the variable HIPMDLISR, which indicates whether the person had any plan that provided a preferred list of doctors at a lower cost.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). Very few persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center.


Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, responses for respondents who mistakenly indicated their private coverage status were edited by the NCHS. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from a list of categories on a card. The frequencies provided in HIP1MDLIS reflect responses in which private insurance was verified though editing on plan names.

Definitions

For the years in which HIP1RXCOV is available, the definition of "private health insurance" remained the same. For all years, respondents who answered the question for HIP1RXCOV had private health insurance, defined as any type of health insurance  excluding  single service plans, or plans that paid for only type of service. From 2001 forward, COBRA and TCC were specifically included as private health insurance. 

Data Editing and Recoding

HIP1RXCOV is part of a series of follow-up questions for individuals who indicated they had private health insurance. The frequencies provided in HIP1RXCOV reflect responses which have been edited based on plan names. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the editing process.


Not all persons were accurate in reporting what type of health insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the type of insurance coverage the person selected (when handed a card listing various types) and the verbatim name of the insurance plan. For this reason, the NCHS edited the responses to reassign persons to the correct type of insurance coverage. ]]></txt>

The IPUMS NHIS has also created the variable HIPEMPAYR, available for 1989 forward for years in which survey data is available, which indicates whether the respondent had any private plan paid for by the employer.

Please use the IHIS drop down menu and search functions for other related variables.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see the related variables HIP2EMP, HIP3EMP, and HIP4EMP. 

 Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). Very few people (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) have more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center. See the 2004 Survey Description document available on the NHIS website for more information.


For all years, HIP1EMP is available, the definition of private insurance coverage remained relatively consistent and excluded single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents. However, the definition, order, and wording of private health insurance changed over time.  Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, HIP1EMP reflects responses that have been edited by the NCHS based on plan name. Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1EMP.  A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the "more" link below.


To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables, which are edited to correct for respondents mistakes of insurance information. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Private insurance companies are allowed to administer portions of Medicaid benefits through Medicaid managed care arrangements in which health maintenance organizations contract directly with a state Medicaid agency to provide services on a capitated basis (fixed fee per enrollee). These managed care plans then enroll and provide services for Medicaid beneficiaries. For example the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided a listing of insurance plans contracting with Medicaid in each state in a 2009 report entitled, "2009 National Summary of State Medicaid Managed Care Programs." Users may want to review other documents on the CMS website for further information on such payment arrangements.

HIP1CAID was edited by the NCHS.  Responses were edited based on the plan name to improve accuracy. 


To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.

As enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in private health insurance plans, instead of through the original Medicare plans (Parts A and B). These programs were known as "Medicare + Choice" or "Part C" plans. Part C is known as "Medicare Advantage" (MA). For people who choose to enroll in a Medicare Advantage health plan, their coverage is provided through private insurance companies.  Medicare pays a private health insurance company plan a fixed amount every month. Users may want to review information provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for more information.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for the first and second plans are publicly available. Users may want to see the related variables HIP2CARE, HIP3CARE, and HIP4CARE. Users may also want to use the variable HIPCARER, a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff that indicates if the respondent had any plan paid for by Medicare.

HIP1CARE was edited for accuracy by the NCHS.  Responses were edited based on plan name. A full description of the editing that occurred is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in  HIPRIVATE  and HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the link "more" below.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who indicated they have a private insurance plan at the time of the survey, this variable indicates the person's first plan was paid for by the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Private insurance coverage that is paid for by SCHIP funds are known as "Premium assistance programs."  These programs subsidize employer premiums, but the public cost is less than providing full coverage through public programs.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for the first and second plans are publicly available. Users may also want to see the variables HIP2CHIP, HIP3CHIP, and HIP4CHIP.  In addition, the IPUMS NHIS has created a recoded variable which indicates if the respondent has any plan paid for by CHIP HIPCHIPR.

HIP1CHIP was edited for accuracy by the NCHS based on plan name.  Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1CHIP. A full description of the editing that occurred is provided under the variable descriptions for HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the link "more" below.


To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1CHIP, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they in did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HIP1CHIP.

      <labl>Plan 1: Paid for by government program</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who have at least one private insurance plan, HIP1OGOV indicates whether the person's  first plan was paid for by a government program.

For all years, if the person reported "government program," then interviewers were instructed to probe to see if the program was Medicare or Medicaid (or SCHIP for 1999 forward) before entering the code for government program. If the respondent indicated that the government was their employer, the response was coded as "employer or union".

The 1998  Field Representative's Manual includes the following example of a private plan that is obtained through a government program: 

"is a type of private insurance for which state or local government or community effort pays for part or all of the cost of a private insurance plan, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  The individual may also contribute the cost of the health insurance and may receive a card such as a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card.  A community program or effort may
include a variety of mechanisms to achieve health insurance for persons who would otherwise be uninsured.  An example would be a private company giving a grant to an HMO to pay for health insurance coverage."

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available.  Users may want to see the variables HIP2OGOV, HIP3OGOV, and HIP4OGOV.  In addition the IPUMS NHIS has created the recoded variable, HIPOGOVR, which indicates whether if the respondent had any plan paid for by some other government program.

For all years in which HIP1OGOV is available, single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance.

HIP1OGOV reflects a verbatim response and is not edited for accuracy based on the plan name.  A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable description for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the "more" link below.

To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1OGOV, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HI1POGOV.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons with at least one private insurance plan, this variable indicates whether the person's first plan was paid for by someone outside the household. Interviewers did not probe to identify or describe who the "someone" was, and no identification of the "someone" was determined in the survey.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available.

Users may want to also use the related variables HIP2OUT, HIP3OUT, and HIP4OUT. Users may also want to use the variable HIPOUTR, a recoded variable created by the IPUMS NHIS staff that indicates whether the respondent had any plan paid for by someone outside the household.

Users should note that the definition and measurement of private health insurance changed over time. For all years, single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the definition of private insurance. A brief discussion of the editing of private insurance coverage is provided in text under "more."


Data Editing and Recoding

The frequencies provided in HIP1OUT reflect responses to whether or not the respondent had private insurance that have been edited for accuracy. Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1OUT.

To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1OUT, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HIP1OUT.

The NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables which are edited to correct for respondents' mistakes of insurance information. The NCHS strongly advises
analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who indicated they have a private insurance plan, this variable indicates whether the first plan was paid for by the person or a family member (living in the household). The text "living in the household" was added to the survey for 2004; for 1997- 2003, the text read "Self or Family." If the respondent was self-employed and obtained coverage through self-employment or professional associations, then they would report coverage under  HIP1EMP, employer-sponsored private coverage obtained through the workplace.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see the related variables HIP2SELF, HIP3SELF, and HIP4SELF . The IPUMS NHIS has also created the variable HIPBUYOWNR, available for 1976 forward for years in which survey data is available, which indicates whether the respondent had any private plan purchased directly.

 Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). A very small number of persons have more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center.


Users should note that the definition and measurement of private health insurance changed over time. For all years HIP1SELF is available, the definition remained consistent. Private insurance generally referred to any type of insurance other than the public programs asked about in the survey, and excluded single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents. Users can review the user note, "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance" when comparing surveys from before and after 1997.

Data Editing and Recoding

The frequencies provided in HIP1SELF reflect responses that have been edited based on the plan name by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1SELF. A full description of the editing process used by the NCHS and changes in definition are provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the "more" link below.

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1SELF, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they in did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HIP1SELF.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who were covered by two private insurance plans, the second of which was paid for by the person or a family member living in the household, ("2" for HIP2SELF), this variable indicates the amount spent for insurance premiums, including payroll deductions. Respondents provided the amount in dollars spent on premiums (as a continuous measure) and the time period (month, week, etc). The IPUMS NHIS recode for HIP2COST also indicates whether the amount reported was more than $20,000 dollars (code "20000").

For 1999 to 2001, interviewers asked respondents for the amount paid on premiums in the past 12 months (e.g., "During the PAST 12 MONTHS, how much did {you/your family} spend for health insurance premiums for {plan name}?"). For 2002 forward, respondents were asked how much they (or their family} currently spend for health insurance premiums for each plan and could then specify the time period for the expenditure (e.g., once a week, a month or yearly). For 2002, responses were recoded to indicate annual expenditure.

In general, the definition and measurement of private health insurance for 1999 forward remained consistent. Single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the change in measurement of private insurance over time.

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The responses for HIP2COST reflect editing by NCHS to ensure that respondents do have private insurance.

Angina pectoris, which was not defined in the survey documentation, consists of sudden attacks of constricting pressure or pain, often in the chest, resulting from not enough blood and oxygen getting to the heart muscle.

In the 2002 and 2007 surveys, persons who acknowledged ever being diagnosed with angina were asked the follow-up question, "During the past 12 months, have you had angina pectoris?" (ANGIPECYR).

Related Variables

Angina is generally caused by coronary heart disease.  In 1997 forward, sample adults were asked whether they were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIEV).  Sample adults were also consistently asked whether they had ever been diagnosed with a heart attack or myocardial infarction (HEARTATTEV) or any other heart condition or heart disease (other than heart attack, angina pectoris, and coronary heart disease) (HEARTCONEV).  In 2002 and 2007, follow-up questions for those giving affirmative answers covered whether sample adults had a heart attack (HEARTATYR), coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIYR), or any other heart condition or heart disease (HEARTCONYR) during the past 12 months.  The 1999 survey collected information on age when first diagnosed with a heart attack (HEARTATAGE). 

In 1999 and 2002, the survey collected information on whether sample adults were ever diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CONHFAILEV) and, in 2002, about whether they had congestive heart failure during the past 12 months (CONHFAILYR).

The 1977 survey included a single, broad question covering all types of heart disease or heart trouble.  Specifically, persons age 20 and older were asked, "During the past 12 months, did you have heart disease or heart trouble?" (HEARTDISYR).

For sample children, from 1997 forward, information was collected on whether the child was ever diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CONGHARTEV) or with some other (non-congenital) heart condition (NONCONHARTEV).

      <labl>Ever told had asthma</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASTHMAEV identifies sample adults/persons and sample children whom a doctor or other health professional had ever diagnosed as having asthma.

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to "accept asthma of any kind, such as smoker's asthma, bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, and the like," but to "not accept self-diagnosed lung problems or conditions reported by a person who is not a doctor and not working with or for a doctor."

The Manual provided definitions of asthma, but these definitions were not routinely shared with respondents. In 1998-2000, asthma was defined as "a condition marked by recurrent attacks which include breathing difficulty and wheezing." Beginning in 2001, asthma was defined as "a chronic respiratory disorder characterized by labored breathing and wheezing resulting from obstructed and constricted air passages."

Other Asthma-Related Variables

Some asthma-related variables, such as ASTHMAEV, were included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) every year, beginning in 1997.  From 1997 forward, the NHIS included questions about whether, in the past 12 months, individuals had an asthma attack (ASTHATAKYR) and had visited an emergency room for asthma (ASTHERYR). Beginning in 2001, individuals ever diagnosed with asthma were consistently asked whether they still had asthma (ASTHMASTIL).

Most of the questions related to asthma were, however, only included in the survey periodically. The 1999 and 2003 surveys were particularly notable for the large number of asthma-related variables they included. According to the 2003 Manual, the new asthma questions for that year were "part of the Healthy People 2010 Initiative."

One group of the "periodic" asthma questions addressed the effects of the illness, in terms of the use of health care or disability days. Variables in this group included:

Had hospital stay for asthma, past 12 months (ASTHOSPYR, in 1999, 2003, 2008, 2013)
Number hospital stays for asthma, past 12 months (ASTHOSPYRNO, in 1999)
Days missed due to asthma, past 12 months (ASTHDAYR, in 2002-2003, 2008, 2013)

A second group of periodically-available asthma questions dealt with the use of asthma medications. These included:

Used over the counter meds for asthma, past 12 months (ASTHOTCYR, in 1999)
Used prescription inhaler, past 3 months (ASTHPIN3MO, in 1999)
Number canisters prescription inhalers used, past 3 months (ASTHCANSNO, in1999)
Ever used prescription inhaler (ASTHPINEV, in 2003, 2008)
Used prescription inhaler for quick relief, past 3 months (ASTHPINQUICK, in 2003, 2008, 2013)
Used more than 3 cans prescription inhaler, past 3 months (ASTHCANGT3, in 2003, 2008, 2013)
Ever taken preventive asthma meds (ASTHPREV, in 2002-2003, 2008)
Now taking preventive asthma meds (ASTHPRENOW, in 2003, 2008, 2013)

The third group of periodically-available asthma-related questions covered "patient education," broadly defined. More specifically, these questions addressed whether an individual had received training from health professionals about managing asthma, about recognizing and effectively treating early warning signs of an asthma episode, and about changing their environment to minimize the risk of attacks. These variables included:

Ever taken class on managing asthma (ASTHCLASS, in 1991, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2008, 2013)
Talk with health professional about managing asthma (ASTHMANAGE, in 2003, 2008)
Ever taught to recognize early signs of asthma episode (ASTHSIGNS, in 2003, 2008, 2013)
Ever taught how to respond to asthma episode (ASTHRESPOND, in 2003, 2008, 2013)
Ever taught to monitor peak flow for daily therapy (ASTHPEAK, in 2003, 2008, 2013)
Shown how to use inhaler (ASTHINSHOW in 2003, 2008)
Ever given an asthma management plan (ASTHPLAN, in 2002-2003, 2008, 2013)
Ever advised to change environment for asthma (ASTHCHEN, in 2002-2003, 2008, 2013)
Followed advice to change environment for asthma (ASTHCHENYES, in 2003, 2008)

Available in 1991 only, ASTHMAYR identifies sample persons who reported that they had asthma during the past 12 months.

In 2007, LUNGPROBYR indicates whether sample children were ever diagnosed by a doctor or other health professional as having lung or breathing problems, other than asthma.

      <txt><![CDATA[CHEARTDIEV identifies sample adults whom a doctor or other health professional ever diagnosed as having coronary heart disease.  In 2002 and 2007, individuals who acknowledged ever being diagnosed with coronary heart disease were asked the follow-up question, "During the past 12 months, have you had coronary heart disease?" (CHEARTDIYR).  

Coronary heart disease was not defined in the survey documentation.  The Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia defines coronary heart disease as follows: "Coronary heart disease (or coronary artery disease) is a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart (coronary arteries).  Coronary disease usually results from the build-up of fatty material and plaque (atherosclerosis).  As the coronary arteries narrow, the flow of blood to the heart can slow or stop.  The disease can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, heart attack, or other symptoms.  Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women."

Related Variables

In 1997 and subsequent years, the survey collected information from sample adults about a number of other conditions related to coronary heart disease.  In 1997 forward, sample adults were asked whether they were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had angina pectoris (ANGIPECEV).  Sample adults were also consistently asked whether they had ever been diagnosed with a heart attack or myocardial infarction (HEARTATTEV) or any other heart condition or heart disease (other than heart attack, angina pectoris, and coronary heart disease) (HEARTCONEV).  In 2002 and 2007, follow-up questions for those giving affirmative answers covered whether sample adults had a heart attack (HEARTATYR), angina pectoris (ANGIPECYR), or any other heart condition or heart disease (HEARTCONYR) during the past 12 months.  The 1999 survey collected information on age when first diagnosed with a heart attack (HEARTATAGE). 

In 1999 and 2002, the survey collected information on whether sample adults were ever diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CONHFAILEV) and, in 2002, about whether they had congestive heart failure during the past 12 months (CONHFAILYR).

The 1977 survey included a single, broad question covering all types of heart disease or heart trouble.  Specifically, persons age 20 and older were asked, "During the past 12 months, did you have heart disease or heart trouble?" (HEARTDISYR).

For sample children, from 1997 forward, information was collected on whether the child was ever diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CONGHARTEV) or with some other (non-congenital) heart condition (NONCONHARTEV).

The Field Representative's Manual for 2001 forward defined Cystic Fibrosis as "an inherited disorder of the exocrine glands, affecting infants and children. Symptoms can include a distended abdomen, diarrhea, malnutrition, and repeated incidence of respiratory infections." This definition was not routinely shared with respondents.

In 1994 and 1995, this variable is part of the Disability Supplement (NHIS-D) that collects information on disability. NHIS-D included two household interviews: in Phase I all members of sample families were screened for any indication of disability; in Phase IIÂ persons with any indication of disability were followed-up for additional information. Phase I includes sensory, communication, and mobility problems; health conditions; activities of daily living and independent activities of daily living; functional limitations; mental health; services and benefits; special health needs of children; early child development; education; relationship to respondent; and perceived disability. Phase II includes four Disability Followback Survey (DFS) questionnaires: one for children, one for adults, one for elderly persons (69 years of age and over) without any indication of disability (also called the Supplement on Aging or SOA; only in 1994), and one for persons with a history of polio.

      <txt><![CDATA[DIABETICEV identifies sample children and sample adults who had ever been diagnosed with "diabetes or sugar diabetes" by a doctor or other health professional.

The format of the questions about diabetes differed for children and adults.  For children, respondents were shown a flashcard listing several chronic conditions (including diabetes) and asked, "Looking at this list, has a doctor or health professional ever told you that [person] had any of these conditions?"  For adults, the question was, "Have you ever been told by a doctor or health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?"  For women, the question was preceded by the phrase, "Other than during pregnancy" (to exclude cases of gestational diabetes present only during pregnancy).

The range of responses recognized also differed for children and adults.  For children, responses were a dichotomous yes and no (or mentioned and not mentioned).  For adults, there was a third option, "Borderline."  Borderline diabetes was not defined in the survey documentation, but outside sources indicate this term refers to "impaired glucose tolerance" or "impaired fasting glucose."  In recent years, the term "pre-diabetes" has increasingly displaced the term "borderline diabetes."

Definitions of Diabetes

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 states, "Do not include self-diagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes, high sugar, or any condition other than 'diabetes' or 'sugar diabetes.'  Do NOT include a doctor's diagnosis of 'gestational diabetes' or diabetes present only when a woman is pregnant."  These directions were not routinely read to respondents and were contradicted by the survey form itself, with its inclusion of the "borderline" option (which overlaps with "pre-diabetes" and "high sugar").

Beginning in 2001, the Manual included the following definition of diabetes: "Diabetes is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate metabolism involving insulin.  Symptoms include elevated sugar in the urine and the blood, excessive urination, thirst, hunger, weight loss, and itching."  This definition was not routinely shared with respondents.


Other Diabetes-Related Variables

Some diabetes-related variables, such as DIABETICEV, were included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) every year, beginning in 1997.  From 1997 forward, the NHIS included questions about age at first diagnosis of diabetes (DIABETICAGE) for adult respondents who reported a diabetes diagnosis (other than "borderline.")  Similarly, beginning in 1997, the survey consistently asked whether persons ever diagnosed with diabetes were now taking insulin (INSULIN) or were now taking diabetic pills (DIAPILLS).  

Other diabetes-related questions were periodically included in the survey, particularly in 1999 and 2003.  The Manual for 2003 reported that the additional diabetes questions in that year were sponsored by the National Institute(s) of Health.
  
One group of the "periodic" diabetes questions collect further information on the time elapsed since first diagnosis of the illness.  These include:
  
Years since first diagnosed with diabetes (DIAYRSAGO, in 1999-2005) 
Diabetes diagnosed in past 12 months (DIAGNOSYR, in 1999) 
Months ago, within year, diabetes diagnosed (DIAGNOSYRMO, in 1999) 

A second group of "periodic" diabetes variables relate to the hemoglobin A1C test, a blood test which provides information about how high an individual's blood sugar level has been over the past 3 months.  These variables include:

Ever heard of hemoglobin A1C (DIA1CKNOW in 1999, 2003) 
Number exams for A1C hemoglobin, past 12 months (DIA1CEXAMYR, in 1999, 2003)
Last A1C hemoglobin level (DIA1CLEVEL, in 2003)
Safe A1C hemoglobin level, according to doctor (DIA1CSAFE, in 2003) 

A third group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables focus on the frequency of checking blood glucose levels.  These variables include:

Times per day check blood for glucose (DIAGLUCDAY, in 2003)
How often check blood for glucose: Time period (DIAGLUCTP, in 2003) 
How often check blood for glucose: Number of units (DIAGLUCNO, in 2003) 

A fourth group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables are concerned with the frequency of checking for foot sores.  These variables include:

Number exams for foot sores, past 12 months (DIAFTEXAMYR, in 1999, 2003)
Times per week check feet for sores (DIAFTEXAMWK, in 2003)
How often check feet for sores: Time period (DIAFTEXAMTP, in 2003)
How often check feet for sores: Number of units (DIAFTEXAMNO, in 2003) 

A fifth group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables relate to eye examinations and eye diseases linked to diabetes.  These variables include:

Months since last eye exam with pupils dilated (DIAEYEXAMO, in 1999, 2002-2003)
Ever told had diabetic retinopathy (DIARETINEV, in 2002) 
Had diabetic retinopathy, past 12 months (DIARETINYR, in 2002)

The last group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables concern contact with health professionals for the treatment and management of diabetes.  These variables include:

Seeing one doctor for diabetes (DIAONEDR, in 2003) Number times saw doctor for diabetes, past 12 months (DIADRYRNO, in 2003) 
Number times saw nurse/dietician for diabetes, past 12 months
(DIANURSYRNO, in 2003) 
Ever took class in diabetes management (DIACLASS, in 1999)

Heart attack was not defined in the survey documentation.  The Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia defines heart attack as follows: "A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when an area of heart muscle dies or is permanently damaged because of an inadequate supply of oxygen to that area."

Related Variables

In the 2002 and 2007 surveys, sample adults ever diagnosed with heart attack were asked if they had a heart attack during the past twelve months (HEARTATYR).  In the 1999 survey, sample adults who were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had a heart attack were asked their age when first diagnosed with a heart attack (HEARTATAGE). 

Heart attacks are generally associated with coronary heart disease.  In 1997 forward, sample adults were asked whether they were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIEV).  Sample adults were also consistently asked whether they had ever been diagnosed with angina pectoris (ANGIPECEV) or any other heart condition or heart disease (other than heart attack, angina pectoris, and coronary heart disease) (HEARTCONEV).  In 2002 and 2007, follow-up questions for those giving affirmative answers covered whether sample adults had angina pectoris (ANGIPECYR), coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIYR), or any other heart condition or heart disease (HEARTCONYR) during the past 12 months.   

In 1999 and 2002, the survey collected information on whether sample adults were ever diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CONHFAILEV) and, in 2002, about whether they had congestive heart failure during the past 12 months (CONHFAILYR).

The 1977 survey included a single, broad question covering all types of heart disease or heart trouble.  Specifically, persons age 20 and older were asked, "During the past 12 months, did you have heart disease or heart trouble?" (HEARTDISYR).

For sample children, from 1997 forward, information was collected on whether the child was ever diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CONGHARTEV) or with some other (non-congenital) heart condition (NONCONHARTEV).

The Manuals for 1997-2000 also included the directive, "Do not include reports of 'potential hypertension' or 'borderline hypertension.'"

The Manuals for 2001 forward provided the following definition of hypertension:

Hypertension, also called high blood pressure, is elevated blood pressure resulting from an increase in the amount of blood pumped by the heart or from increased resistance to the flow of blood through the small arterial blood vessels (arterioles).

Neither these directions nor this definition were routinely shared with respondents.

In 2002 and 2007, persons giving an affirmative answer to HYPERTENEV were asked whether they had hypertension during the past 12 months (HYPERTENYR).  (Such information was also collected for all persons age 20 and older in 1977.)

In 1999, a separate question identified sample adults whom a doctor or other health professional had diagnosed as having kidney stones in the past 12 months (KIDNYSTONYR).   In 2002 and 2007, sample adults who had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had urinary problems (such as incontinence, frequent or slow urination, or infections) were identified (URINPROBEV).   Those identified as ever having such urinary problems were asked whether they had such problems during the past 12 months (URINPROBYR).]]></txt>

Noncongenital heart disease, which was not defined in the survey documentation, refers to any type of heart problem other than a structural problem in the heart that is present at birth.  

The 1997 Field Representative's Manual identified a number of conditions falling under the rubric of heart disease in children.  Specifically, "heart disease or heart condition can include any of the following: congenital heart disease, chronic heart condition, rheumatic heart disease, heart murmurs, atrial or mitral valve disease/damage, etc."  For 1998 forward, the Manual replaced this listing with a single broad statement: "Heart disease or heart condition should be included if a doctor has told the parent or guardian that the child has any kind of heart problem or condition."  Neither of these statements was routinely shared with respondents.]]></txt>

      <labl>Ever told had a stroke</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[STROKEV identifies adults whom a doctor or other health professional ever diagnosed as having had a stroke.  In 2002 and 2007, persons who had ever been diagnosed with a stroke were asked whether they had a stroke during the past 12 months (STROKEYR). Please see Comparability and Universe tabs for complete information on universe changes between samples.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to "include strokes, cerebrovascular accidents, and brain hemorrhages," but this directive was not stated during the interview.  Stroke was defined in the Field Representative's Manual for 2001 forward as "a cerebral hemorrhage or embolism of the cerebral blood vessels," but this definition was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables


Information on whether persons age 20 and older ever had a stroke is also available in 1977 (STROKEWOC).  The information included in STROKEWOC was collected via two separate lines of questioning.  Interviewers asked, "Has [name] ever had a stroke?" and "Has a doctor ever told [name] he had a stroke?"  In addition, the person was recorded as having had a stroke and asked about a doctor's diagnosis of the condition if "stroke" was reported as the reason why an individual was limited in daily activities (i.e., "needs the help of another person in getting around," "stays in bed all or most of the day," "needs help in bathing/dressing/eating/using the toilet"). 

Only cases coded as "2" (Yes, medically confirmed) in STROKEWOC are roughly comparable to cases with an affirmative response in STROKEV.   Along with the notable difference in question wording for the two variables, there is a difference in the range of responses that were accepted.  In the 1977 inquiry, interviewers were directed to reask the question if a term other than "stroke" (such as "brain hemorrhage") was reported, and to consider as a "No" response any term other than "stroke."  By contrast, as noted above, for STROKEV, other terms such as "cerebral hemorrhage" and "cerebrovascular accident" were accepted as "Yes" responses.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Bladder</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNBLAD identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had bladder cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  For 1997 forward, the Field Representative's Manual directed: "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as bladder cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)

lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of bladder cancer is reported in CNBLADAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Blood</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNBLOD identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had blood cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as blood cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of blood cancer is reported in CNBLODAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Bone</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNBONE identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had bone cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as bone cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of bone cancer is reported in CNBONEAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Brain</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNBRAN identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had brain cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as brain cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of brain cancer is reported in CNBRANAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Breast</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNBRES identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had breast cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as breast cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of breast cancer is reported in CNBRESAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Cervix</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNCERV identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had cervical cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as cervical cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of cervical cancer is reported in CNCERVAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Colon</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNCOLN identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had colon cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as colon cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of colon cancer is reported in CNCOLNAG.

      <txt><![CDATA[CNESOP identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had esophageal cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as esophageal cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of esophageal cancer is reported in CNESOPAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Gall bladder</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNGALL identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had gallbladder cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as gallbladder cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
 (non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of gallbladder cancer is reported in CNGALLAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Kidney</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNKIDN identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had kidney cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as kidney cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of kidney cancer is reported in CNKIDNAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Larynx-windpipe</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNLARX identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had larynx-windpipe cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as larynx-windpipe cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of larynx-windpipe cancer is reported in CNLARXAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Leukemia</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNLEUK identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had leukemia.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as leukemia, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of leukemia is reported in CNLEUKAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Liver</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNLIVR identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had liver cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as liver cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of liver cancer is reported in CNLIVRAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Lung</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNLUNG identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had lung cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as lung cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of lung cancer is reported in CNLUNGAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Lymphoma</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNLYMP identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had lymphoma. Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer. The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind. For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer." Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents. If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as lymphoma, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN)
breast cancer (CNBRES)
cervical cancer (CNCERV)
colon cancer (CNCOLN)
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL)
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK)
liver cancer (CNLIVR)
lung cancer (CNLUNG)
melanoma (CNMELN)
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH)
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR)
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS)
rectal cancer (CNRECT)
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM)
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK)
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT)
stomach cancer (CNSTOM)
testicular cancer (CNTEST)
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR)
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer. Age at first diagnosis of lymphoma is reported in CNLYMPAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Melanoma</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNMELN identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had melanoma.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as melanoma, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of melanoma is reported in CNMELNAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Mouth/tongue/lip</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNMOTH identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had mouth, lip, or tongue cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as mouth, lip, or tongue cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of mouth, lip, or tongue cancer is reported in CNMOTHAG.

Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


The term "other kind of cancer" refers to a type of cancer other than the following specific types of cancer, each of which was the subject of a separate dichotomous variable:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of some kind of cancer other than those specified above is reported in CNOTHRAG.

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who had ever been told that they had a kind of cancer other than the kinds listed on the survey form (CNOTHR), CNOTHRAG reports how old the person was when this "other kind" of cancer was first diagnosed. 

Related Variables


A series of variables report age at first diagnosis of the specific types of cancer listed on the survey form:

blood cancer (CNBLODAG)

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Ovarian</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNOVAR identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had ovarian cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of CNOVAR is reported in CNOVARAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Pancreatic</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNPANC identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had pancreatic cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is reported in CNPANCAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Prostate</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNPROS identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had prostate cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as prostate cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of prostate cancer is reported in CNPROSAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Rectal</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNRECT identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had rectal cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as rectal cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of rectal cancer is reported in CNRECTAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Skin (don't know what kind)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNSKDK identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had skin cancer of an unknown type.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as skin cancer of an unknown type, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of skin cancer of an unknown type is reported in CNSKDKAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Skin (non-melanoma)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNSKNM identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had (non-melanoma) skin cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as (non-melanoma) skin cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of (non-melanoma) skin cancer is reported in CNSKNMAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Soft tissue (muscle)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNSOFT identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer is reported in CNSOFTAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Stomach</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNSTOM identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had stomach cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as stomach cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN)

lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of stomach cancer is reported in CNSTOMAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Testicular</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNTEST identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had testicular cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as testicular cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of testicular cancer is reported in CNTESTAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Throat-pharynx</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNTHRO identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had throat-pharynx cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as throat-pharynx cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:  

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR) 
uterine cancer (CNUTER)
 
Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of throat-pharynx cancer is reported in CNTHROAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Thyroid</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNTHYR identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had thyroid cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  For 1997 forward, the Field Representative's Manual directed: "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as thyroid cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer: 

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
uterine cancer (CNUTER)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of thyroid cancer is reported in CNTHYRAG.

      <labl>Ever had cancer: Uterine</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CNUTER identifies sample adults who had ever been told that they had uterine cancer.  Those sample adults who reported ever being told by a doctor or other health professional that they had cancer or a malignancy of any kind (CANCEREV) were asked the follow-up question, "What kind of cancer was it?"   

Interviewers marked up to three kinds of cancer specified on the survey form, and noted when the respondent mentioned more than three types of cancer.  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manual directed, "Count the same type of cancer or malignancy on different body parts as only one kind.  For example, malignant moles on the face, neck, and trunk should be counted as only one kind of cancer."  Interviewers were further directed to not read the answer categories on the survey form to respondents.  If the respondent used a technical term not on the form, then the interviewer was to "ask what part of the body this affected and enter that"; if the answer did not fit a category on the form, then the interviewer was to mark "other" and write down the response.

The coded responses to "What kind of cancer was it?" were the basis of a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a particular type of cancer, such as uterine cancer, was mentioned by a respondent who was ever diagnosed with cancer.   

Related Variables


Other dichotomous variables in this series identify sample adults mentioning the following types of cancer:

bladder cancer (CNBLAD)
blood cancer (CNBLOD)
bone cancer (CNBONE)
brain cancer (CNBRAN) 
breast cancer (CNBRES) 
cervical cancer (CNCERV) 
colon cancer (CNCOLN) 
esophageal cancer (CNESOP)
gallbladder cancer (CNGALL) 
kidney cancer (CNKIDN)
larynx-windpipe cancer (CNLARX)
leukemia (CNLEUK) 
liver cancer (CNLIVR) 
lung cancer (CNLUNG) 
lymphoma (CNLYMP) 
melanoma (CNMELN) 
mouth, lip, or tongue cancer (CNMOTH) 
ovarian cancer (CNOVAR) 
pancreatic cancer (CNPANC)
prostate cancer (CNPROS) 
rectal cancer (CNRECT) 
(non-melanoma) skin cancer (CNSKNM) 
skin cancer of an unknown type (CNSKDK) 
soft tissue (muscle or fat) cancer (CNSOFT) 
stomach cancer (CNSTOM) 
testicular cancer (CNTEST) 
throat-pharynx cancer (CNTHRO)
thyroid cancer (CNTHYR)

Those who mentioned any other kind of cancer not previously listed are identified in CNOTHR, while those who mentioned having been diagnosed with more than three types of cancer are identified in CNKIND3.

Interviewers asked the additional follow-up question, "How old were you when [this cancer] was first diagnosed?" This information was again collected for up to three specific types of cancer.  Age at first diagnosis of uterine cancer is reported in CNUTERAG.

      <txt><![CDATA[DIABETICAGE reports age at first diagnosis by a doctor of "diabetes or sugar diabetes," for sample adults who were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes (other than during pregnancy alone) (DIABETICEV).  Persons who reported their diagnosis as "borderline" diabetes were not asked this follow-up question. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe for a specific age but to "record a best estimate if that is what the sample adult gives you."

The 2006 Codebook for the NHIS public use data files contains the following warning about inaccuracies in this variable:

These data have not been edited for reasonableness. Some respondents appear to give information on how long ago the condition was first diagnosed rather than their age when the condition was first diagnosed.

Other diabetes-related questions were periodically included in the survey; see DIABETICEV for a summary of these variables currently in the IPUMS NHIS.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[INSULIN reports responses to the question, "Are you now taking insulin?"  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration website on diabetes information notes that insulin is taken by diabetics to control blood sugar levels and that insulin cannot be taken by mouth because it would be destroyed by digestion.  Instead, insulin is injected through shots or other devices such as insulin pens, jet injectors, or pumps.  

Respondents who received the question associated with INSULIN were also asked if they were currently taking diabetic pills, also called oral agents or oral hypoglycemic agents, to lower their blood sugar (DIAPILLS).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes (other than during pregnancy) (DIABETICEV), DIAYRSAGO reports the number of years since they were first diagnosed with diabetes.   

DIAYRSAGO is a recoded variable calculated as the difference between current age (AGE) and reported age at the onset of diabetes (DIABETICAGE).   The Codebooks for 1999 forward note, "For persons age 85 or older, this difference may be an underestimate"--due to the fact that both AGE and DIABETICAGE are topcoded at age 85.   Persons who had been diagnosed with "borderline diabetes" (in DIABETICEV) were not asked the follow-up question about age at onset of diabetes.]]></txt>

      <labl>Last A1C hemoglobin level</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes (other than during pregnancy) (DIABETICEV), who had heard of hemoglobin A1C (DIA1CKNOW), and who had their hemoglobin A1C checked in the past year (DIA1CEXAMYR), DIA1CLEVEL reports their last hemoglobin A1C level. 

A second variable also only available in 2003, DIA1CSAFE, reports what such persons' hemoglobin A1C level should be, according their doctor, nurse, or other health professional.   

According to the Adult Health Advisor website from the University of Michigan Health System, 

The hemoglobin A1c percentage rises as your average blood sugar level rises.  The normal range for a person without diabetes is 4 to 6%.  The goal for most adults with diabetes is an A1c below 7%.  For some people, the goal should be 6% or less.  For others, the A1c goal may need to be slightly higher than 7% (for example, the very elderly).

The American Diabetes Association guidelines similarly call for a level of hemoglobin A1C of 7 percent or less as desirable for persons with diabetes.

Other diabetes-related questions were periodically included in the survey; see DIABETICEV for a summary of these variables currently in the IPUMS NHIS.]]></txt>

Before posing this question, interviewers stated, "These next questions are about drinking alcoholic beverages.  Included are liquor such as whiskey or gin, beer, wine, wine coolers, and any other type of alcoholic beverage."

ALCLIFE, like ALC1YR, functioned largely as a filter for further questioning about alcoholic consumption during the past year.  If sample adults did not acknowledge having had 12+ drinks in any one year (ALC1YR), they were asked, "In your entire life, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcoholic beverage?"  If they gave a positive response to this question, they were asked about the frequency and amount of their drinking in the previous twelve months (ALCAMT).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who acknowledged drinking in the past year, ALCAMT reports the average number of alcoholic beverages consumed by sample adults on the days that they drink or drank. Alcoholic beverages include liquor, beer, wine, wine coolers, and any other type of alcoholic beverage."

ALCAMT accommodates responses of from less than 1 to 95+ drinks.  Researchers should exercise caution in interpreting very high values for ALCAMT; persons who gave a response of, for example, 95+ drinks may have misunderstood the question (e.g., they may have given a response related to the number of days that they drank or related to a different reference period, such as the number of drinks per year).    

The National Center for Health Statistics did not edit responses in ALCAMT to insure consistency with responses to other questions related to the level of alcohol consumption in the past year, such as the number of days per year that the respondent consumed 5+ drinks (ALC5UPYR).]]></txt>

      <labl>Frequency drank alcohol in past year: Days per week</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ALCDAYSWK reports the number of days per week during the past year that the sample adult drank alcoholic beverages.  

Interviewers began the section of the survey on alcohol by stating, "These next questions are about drinking alcoholic beverages.  Included are liquor such as whiskey or gin, beer, wine, wine coolers, and any other type of alcoholic beverage."   They then asked, "In the past year, how often did you drink alcoholic beverages?"  Respondents could frame an answer using various time units (e.g., "5 times a week," "once a month," "10 times a year"), and the interviewer recorded the number stated and the time period that fit the answer (i.e., "Never/None," "Week," "Month," or "Year").  For the original NHIS public use files, the National Center for Health Statistics recoded these data in terms of days per week (for ALCDAYSWK), in terms of days per month (for ALCDAYSMO), and in terms of days per year (for ALCDAYSYR).

      <txt><![CDATA[ALCDAYSYR reports the number of days per year during the past year that the sample adult drank alcoholic beverages.  

Data Collection and Recoding

Interviewers began the section of the survey on alcohol by stating, "These next questions are about drinking alcoholic beverages.  Included are liquor such as whiskey or gin, beer, wine, wine coolers, and any other type of alcoholic beverage."   They then asked, "In the past year, how often did you drink alcoholic beverages?"  Respondents could frame an answer using various time units (e.g., "5 times a week," "once a month," "10 times a year"), and the interviewer recorded the number stated and the time period that fit the answer (i.e., "Never/None," "Week," "Month," or "Year").  For the original NHIS public use files, the National Center for Health Statistics recoded these data in terms of days per week (for ALCDAYSWK), in terms of days per month (for ALCDAYSMO), and in terms of days per year (for ALCDAYSYR).  

The effect of reporting in time periods shorter than a year (i.e., times per week or per month) is evident in digit clustering in the frequencies for ALCDAYSYR.  There is strong clustering of responses in codes that are multiples of 12, corresponding to responses given in terms of times per month.  Users should, therefore, be wary of treating ALCDAYSYR as a simple interval variable.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2001 forward directed interviewers to "always probe for an exact number.  If the sample adult reports a range or interval, assist the sample adult in making an estimate by probing.  For example, you might ask, 'Could you give me a more exact number?'"   To the same end, beginning in 2000, the survey instrument instructed interviewers, "If necessary, prompt with 'How many days per week, per month, or per year did you drink?'"

      <labl>Ever smoked 100 cigarettes in life</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[SMOKEV reports whether the respondent has ever smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime. In 1970 interviewers asked, "Has [person] smoked 100 cigarettes during his entire life?" In 1976-1977 and 1997 forward the question wording changed slightly, with interviewers asking, "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?"

Definitions and Instructions

The 1970 Field Representative's Manual instructed interviewers to "[e]xclude marijuana, a type of wild tobacco, (also called "pot" or "grass')" when accepting responses to the smoking-related questions.

According to the 1970 Manual, if respondents volunteered that they smoked cigarettes made of non-tobacco products, "such as lettuce or cabbage leaves," interviewers were to rephrase the question to, "Excluding any nontobacco cigarettes, have you smoked at least...?"

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."

The 1970 Field Manual states that one hundred cigarettes is equal to five packs, but instructs interviewers to "ask the question as worded because the respondent might misinterpret 'five packs' as referring to five packs a day.


Related Variables

In 1997 forward respondents who answered "Yes" in SMOKEV (Ever smoked 100 cigarettes in life) were asked, "Do you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?" (SMOKFREQNOW). Depending on their response in SMOKFREQNOW, respondents were also able to receive one or more of the following questions in 1997 forward:

"On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY1)
"On how many of the past 30 days did you smoke a cigarette?" (CIGDAYMO)
"On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY2)

The variable CIGSDAY (Average number of cigarettes smoked per day: Current Smokers) is available for 1970, 1976-1977, and 1997 forward. The variable SMOKAGEREG (available for 1970 and 1997 forward) reports the age at which respondents first started to smoke "fairly regularly."

Data Collection and Question Wording

For 1997 forward respondents were asked, "How old were you when you FIRST started to smoke fairly regularly?" This question was asked of sample adults age 18+ who reported having ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV).

In 1970 respondents were asked, "About how old was [person] when he first started smoking cigarettes fairly regularly?" Before receiving the question associated with SMOKAGE, respondents were asked whether they had ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV) and whether they currently smoked. Respondents who reported having ever smoked 100 cigarettes or for whom it was unknown whether they had ever smoked 100 cigarettes and who either reported that they did not currently smoke or had an unknown answer for whether they currently smoked were asked the follow-up question, "How long has it been since [person] smoked cigarettes fairly regularly?" Only respondents who did not report that they never smoked regularly to this question were asked the question associated with SMOKAGEREG. Also included in the universe for SMOKAGEREG in 1970 are respondents who reported having ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV) and who indicated that they currently smoked.


Definitions and Instructions

The 1970 Field Representative's Manual instructed interviewers to "[e]xclude marijuana, a type of wild tobacco, (also called "pot" or "grass')" when accepting responses to the smoking-related questions.

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."

The 1970 Manual defined "fairly regularly" as "smoking one or more cigarettes on three or more consecutive days." The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward stated that "first started to smoke fairly regularly" and "smoking regularly" are respondent defined. If respondents asked what it meant, the Manuals for 1997 forward instructed interviewers say, "'It's whatever you consider as first starting to smoke fairly regularly.'"

In 1970, the Manual instructed that "if a person does not remember his exact age when he first started smoking cigarettes regularly, obtain his best estimate. As an aid, subtract the number of years from his present age. A person may also be able to relate age started smoking to his high school or college attendance or Armed Forces service."

The Manuals for 1997-2000 instructed interviewers to "Always probe for an exact age" and to assist respondents in making an estimate if they reported a range or interval.

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who have ever smoked 100 cigarettes and currently smoke some days (or whose current smoking status us unknown in 1997-2003), CIGDAYMO reports the number of days in the past 30 days respondents smoked one or more cigarettes.

Definitions and Instruction

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."

When asking the question associated with CIGADYMO, the 1997-2000 Manuals instructed interviewers to "[a]lways probe for an exact number" and to assist respondents in making an estimate if they reported a range or interval. The 1997-2000 Manuals also instructed interviewers, "If asked, explain that 'past 30 days' includes up to the day before the interview and not the day of the interview."


Related Variables

"Some day" smokers who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days during the past 30 days (according to CIGDAYMO) were asked the follow-up question, "On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?" Responses to this question are reported in CIGSDAY2.

"Every day" smokers (IHIS code 3 in SMOKFREQNOW) were asked, "On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY1). The variable CIGSDAY combines responses given to the questions associated with CIGSDAY1 and CIGSDAY2, reporting the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for "current smokers" (i.e., all "every day" smokers and "some day" smokers who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days in the past 30 days). The universe for CIGSDAY also includes (in 1997-2003) respondents whose current smoking status was unknown (IHIS code 7-9 in SMOKFREQNOW). Respondents whose smoking status was unknown were all coded as "Unknown-not ascertained" in CIGSDAY (IHIS code 98).

CIGSDAY also reports the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for persons age 17+ who were current smokers (1970) and persons age 20+ who were part of a 1/3 subsample and who were current smokers (1976-1977).

      <labl>Number cigarettes per day (current smokers)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CIGSDAY reports the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for all "current smokers."

In 1970 and 1976-1977 respondents who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV) and who reported that they "smoke cigarettes now" were asked, "On the average, about how many cigarettes a day [does person/do you] smoke?"

In 1989 this question was included in the Diabetes supplement, and asked of sample adults who did not have diabetes and were current smokers. In that year, it is complementary to DIACIGSDAY, which was asked of all adults who are current smokers and have confirmed diabetes.

Question Wording

In 1997 forward, respondents who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV) and who were "Every day" smokers (IPUMS NHIS code 3 in SMOKFREQNOW) were asked, "On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?" with responses recorded in CIGSDAY1. Respondents who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV), who were "Some day" smokers (IHIS code 2 in SMOKFREQNOW), and who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days during the past 30 days (according to CIGDAYMO) were asked, "On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?" Responses to this question are reported in CIGSDAY2. The variable CIGSDAY combines responses given to the questions associated with CIGSDAY1 and CIGSDAY2, reporting the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for "current smokers" (i.e., all "every day" smokers and "some day" smokers who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days in the past 30 days). The universe for CIGSDAY also includes (in 1997-2003) respondents whose current smoking status was unknown (IHIS code 7-9 in SMOKFREQNOW). Respondents whose smoking status was unknown were all coded as "Unknown-not ascertained" in CIGSDAY (IHIS code 98).


Definitions and Instructions

The 1970 Field Representative's Manual instructed interviewers to "[e]xclude marijuana, a type of wild tobacco, (also called "pot" or "grass')" when accepting responses to the question associated with CIGSDAY.

The question for CIGSDAY in 1977 was asked for a sub-sample of randomly selected persons age 20 and over; NHIS automatically classifies persons who were selected but did not complete the questions as not in universe for this variable. Users may choose to use this variable in combination with SUBSRESP77, which reports the person's sub-sample status in 1977.

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."

The 1970 Field Representative's Manual instructed interviewers, "If the response is expressed in 'pack(s)' smoked per day, convert this to the number of individual cigarettes smoked (20 to a pack). For example, if a person reports 'About a pack and a half a day,' enter '30' for the number smoked per day." The Manuals for 1976-1977 and 1997-2000 included similar instructions. The 1997-2000 Manuals added, "verify the result with the Sample Adult (some brands have 25 cigarettes per pack)."

The 1970 Manual also included the following instructions:

[E]nter the number of cigarettes the person smokes "per day" at the present time, i.e., as of last Sunday night. The terms "on the average" and "about" indicate that an estimate is acceptable.

If the response is expressed in weeks or months, ask the respondent to estimate the number of cigarettes he smokes per day. If no estimate is available refer to the conversion chart (Card T in your flashcard booklet) [This flashcard was not provided in the documentation released by NCHS]. If a person smokes less than one cigarette a day, enter a dash (-) on the "No. per day" line.

If the respondent answers in intervals, e.g., "10-20 a day," enter this if a more definite answer cannot be obtained. However, if a respondent gives a vague answer, such as "Hardly any at all," try to obtain an estimate of the number of cigarettes he smokes per day.

When asking the question associated with CIGSDAY1 or CIGSDAY2, the 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals instructed interviewers to "[a]lways probe for an exact number" and to assist respondents in making an estimate if they reported a range or interval. For the question associated with CIGSDAY2 (Number of cigarettes smoked per day: Some day smokers), the 1997-2000 Manuals instructed interviewers, "Do NOT include days when the Sample Adult did NOT smoke in computing the average."

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who have ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV) and currently smoke "every day" (IPUMS NHIS code 3 in SMOKFREQNOW), CIGSDAY1 reports responses to the question, "On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?"

Definitions and Instructions

The 1997 forward Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."

When asking the question associated with CIGSDAY1, the 1997 forward Manuals instructed interviewers to "[a]lways probe for an exact number" and to assist respondents in making an estimate if they reported a range or interval. The 1997 forward Manuals also stated, "If the response is given in packs rather than the number of cigarettes, multiply the number of packs by 20, verify the result with the Sample Adult (some brands have 25 cigarettes per pack), and enter the number of cigarettes per day."


Related Variables

Respondents who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV), who were "Some day" smokers (IHIS code 2 in SMOKFREQNOW), and who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days during the past 30 days (according to CIGDAYMO) were asked, "On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?" Responses to this question are reported in CIGSDAY2.

The variable CIGSDAY combines responses given to the questions associated with CIGSDAY1 and CIGSDAY2, reporting the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for "current smokers" (i.e., all "every day" smokers and "some day" smokers who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days in the past 30 days). The universe for CIGSDAY also includes (in 1997-2003) respondents whose current smoking status was unknown (IHIS code 7-9 in SMOKFREQNOW). Respondents whose smoking status was unknown were all coded as "Unknown-not ascertained" in CIGSDAY (IHIS code 98).

CIGSDAY also reports the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for persons age 17+ who were current smokers (1970) and persons age 20+ who were part of a 1/3 subsample and who were current smokers (1976-1977).

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who have ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV), currently smoke "some days" (IPUMS NHIS code 2 in SMOKFREQNOW), and smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days during the past 30 days (CIGDAYMO), CIGSDAY2 reports responses to the question, "On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?"  The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals instructed interviewers not to include days "when the Sample Adult did NOT smoke" when computing the average.

Definitions and Instructions

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only.  Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like."  The Manuals for 1991-1995 and from 2001 forward define a cigarette as anything "the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."

When asking the question associated with CIGSDAY2, the 1997-2000 Manuals instructed interviewers to "[a]lways probe for an exact number" and to assist respondents in making an estimate if they reported a range or interval.  The 1991-2000 Manuals also stated, "If the response is given in packs rather than the number of cigarettes, multiply the number of packs by 20, verify the result with the Sample Adult (some brands have 25 cigarettes per pack), and enter the number of cigarettes per day."


Related Variables

Respondents who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes (SMOKEV) and who were "Every day" smokers (IHIS code 3 in SMOKFREQNOW) were asked, "On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY1).  The variable CIGSDAY combines responses given to the questions associated with CIGSDAY1 and CIGSDAY2, reporting the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for "current smokers" (i.e., all "every day" smokers and "some day" smokers who smoked 1+ days or an unknown number of days in the past 30 days).  The universe for CIGSDAY also includes (in 1997-2003) respondents whose current smoking status was unknown (IHIS code 7-9 in SMOKFREQNOW).  Respondents whose smoking status was unknown were all coded as "Unknown-not ascertained" in CIGSDAY (IHIS code 98).

CIGSDAY also reports the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for persons age 17+ who were current smokers (1970) and persons age 20+ who were part of a 1/3 subsample and who were current smokers (1976-1977).

      <labl>Cigarette smoking recode 2: Current detailed/former/never</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults 18 and over, this is a recoded variable indicating the respondent's current smoking status in categories of current smoker, every day current smoker, some day current smoker, current smoker--unknown frequency of smoking, and also indicates former smoker, never smoked and "has smoked, current smoking status unknown."


In this variable, current smokers were divided into "every day" smokers or "some days" smokers.  The process to classify respondents into these categories changed slightly between 1991 and 1992 forward.  In 1991, ever smokers were asked if they smoke now; respondents who said "yes" were asked if they smoked "every day" or "some days.  Respondents who answered "no" were asked, "Do you smoke some days or not at all?" This additional follow-up resulted in the classification of persons as "someday smokers" who would otherwise have been considered former smokers, since they initially said that they did not smoke now. 

In 1992, questions on smoking status were included in two sections of the survey; in the  Cancer Control section, the same three questions  from in the 1991 questionnaire were used;  in the Cancer Epidemiology section, just two questions were used: "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes during your entire life?" If yes, "Do you NOW smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?" Use of both sets of questions allowed for estimation of the impact of the question change on population prevalence. The revised current smoking status question was estimated to have resulted in an increase in smoking prevalence of about 1 percent-- a result occurring mainly from capturing smoking among persons who would otherwise have been classified as nonsmokers with the original question.

This version of the question was used from 1992 forward.


Related Variables

Other recoded smoking status variables are included in the NHIS.


These include:
 
SMOKESTATUS1    "never," "current," "former," "former regular smoker," "former occasional smoker," "unknown," and unknown if ever smoked 100 cigarettes," and "smoked 100 cigarettes, unknown if currently smoke." 
SMOKESTATUS3  categorizes respondents into current every day smoker, current some day smoker ((1 or more days, past month),  current some day smoker  (0 days, past month), current some day smoker (unknown days in past month) and also indicates former smoker, never smoked and "has smoked, current smoking status unknown."

      <txt><![CDATA[SMOKFREQNOW reports the responses to the question, "Do you NOW smoke cigarettes every day, some days or not at all?" This question was asked of sample adults who reported having ever smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime (SMOKEV) and for 1991 and 1992, had a known response for whether they currently smoked. 

Definitions and Instructions

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."  The 1991 and 1992 had approximately the same definition. 

Specifically concerning the question associated with SMOKFREQNOW, the Manuals for 1997-2000 instructed interviewers, "If the sample adult gives an answer which does not match the categories read in the question, reread the question emphasizing the wording of the answer categories."


Related Variables

In 1970, 1987, 1992,  and 1997 forward respondents were asked about the age at which they first started smoking "fairly regularly" (SMOKAGEREG).

Depending on their response in SMOKFREQNOW (Smoke every day, some days, or not at all), respondents were also able to receive one or more of the following questions in 1991-1995 and from 1997 forward:

"On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY1)
"On how many of the past 30 days did you smoke a cigarette?" (CIGDAYMO)
"On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY2)

The variable CIGSDAY (Average number of cigarettes smoked per day: Current Smokers) is available for 1970, 1974, 1976-1977, 1985, and 1997 forward.

Definitions and Scope of Inquiry on Physical Activity, 1997 forward

For 1997 forward, interviewers began the inquiry into adult leisure-time physical activity by stating, "The next questions are about physical activities (exercise, sports, physically active hobbies ...) that you may do in your leisure time."  "Exercise, sports, [and] physically active hobbies" were to be respondent defined.

For each year, beginning in 1997, the survey collected information about sample adults' leisure time spent in "vigorous," "light or moderate," and "strengthening" physical activities. (See MOD10FNO and STRONGFNO for definitions of "light or moderate activity" and "strengthening activity".)  In 2001, information was also collected on leisure time spent by sample adults in "stretching" activities. (See STRETCHFNO.) Strengthening and stretching exercises can be done at a pace that is either "vigorous" or "moderate," so exercise sessions involving strengthening and stretching overlap with vigorous and moderate exercise sessions.

For VIG10FNO, beginning in quarter 3 of 1997, sample adults were asked, "How often do you do vigorous leisure-time physical activities for at least 10 minutes that cause heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate?" The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward provide examples of vigorous activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include fast walking, fast bicycling, jogging, strenuous swimming or sports play, vigorous aerobic dance, and strenuous gardening.


Rationale for and Use of Physical Activity Data

The Field Representative's Manuals for 2001 forward noted that information about general health behaviors, including physical activity, "helps researchers measure how a person's daily habits affect his/her overall health." More specifically, according to the Manuals for 2002 forward, responses to the questions about leisure-time physical activity were used "for tracking Healthy People Objectives (22.1-22.4)."  

For example, one such objective framed in terms of vigorous activity is increasing the proportion of adults who "engage in vigorous physical activity that promotes the development and maintenance of cardio respiratory fitness 3 or more days per week for 20 or more minutes per occasion."

Beginning in 2005, NHIS data on physical activity were also used in Health, United States to classify adults as "inactive," "with some leisure time activity," or "with regular leisure-time activity."   This classification system is described in the Appendix of Health, United States for 2005 as follows:

Adults classified as inactive did not report any sessions of light/moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity of at least 10 minutes duration or reported that they were unable to perform leisure-time physical activity.  Adults classified with some leisure-time activity reported at least one session of light/moderate or vigorous activity of at least 10 minutes duration but did not meet the requirement for regular leisure-time activity.  Adults classified with regular leisure-time activity reported at least three sessions per week of vigorous leisure-time physical activity lasting at least 20 minutes in duration or at least 5 sessions per week of light/moderate physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes in duration.


Changes in Data Collection Beginning in 1997

The National Health Interview Series first collected information on physical activity beginning in 1975.  Prior to 1997, these inquiries generally focused on specific activities, such walking or playing baseball.  (See the National Health Interview Survey's summary website on Adult Physical Activity Information in the NHIS [URL omitted from DDI.] for full details.)  

The Survey Descriptions for 1997-2000 note that the physical activity questions included in the sample adult (core) module were "substantially different from those included in pre-1997 NHIS questionnaires." 

Because of the large number of topic areas covered in the redesigned NHIS, only a brief set of leisure-time physical activity questions could be included in the Sample Adult Module.  For this reason, the questions are general and lend themselves to broad classifications of activity levels.

The aforementioned website on "Adult Physical Activity Information in the NHIS" supplies the following background information on the development of these questions:

In 1997, as part of the National Health Interview Survey (core) questionnaire redesign, physical activity questions were included in the [core] questionnaire for the first time. Questions used in Australia, Finland, and Canada, as well as studies of older adults and youth in the United States, influenced the development of the NHIS Sample Adult annual physical activity questions.  Question wording and response options were modified for use in the NHIS Sample Adult questionnaire, tested in the Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory (QDRL) of CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, and included in a field pretest.  Decisions concerning question phrasing, reference period, and response options were based on results of cognitive testing and debriefing of interviewers after the pretest. Consistency with other parts of the National Health Interview Survey questionnaire was also considered.  The final NHIS core physical activity questions consisted of asking frequency and duration of usual leisure-time vigorous and light-moderate activities and the frequency of strengthening activities.

Vigorous leisure-time activities are described in the survey question itself as activities that "cause heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate."  The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward provide examples of vigorous activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include fast walking, fast bicycling, jogging, strenuous swimming or sports play, vigorous aerobic dance, and strenuous gardening.

Definitions

Strengthening activities are described in the survey question itself as activities "specifically designed to strengthen your muscles such as lifting weights or doing calisthenics."  The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward provide other examples of strengthening activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include "activities that require strenuous muscle contractions," such as resistance training, push-ups, and sit-ups.


Data Collection

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 2001 forward, the maximum frequency of each broad category of physical activity was topcoded at 4 times per day (or its equivalent in some other time unit).

Interviewers asked about the frequency of strengthening leisure-time physical activities after collecting information about vigorous and light or moderate leisure-time physical activities.  They directed respondents to "include all such [strengthening] activities, even if you have mentioned them before."  Strengthening activities could be done at either a "moderate" or a "vigorous" pace, and the time spent doing strengthening leisure-time activities was thus already incorporated in the duration variables for moderate and/or vigorous leisure-time physical activity. Accordingly, interviewers did not ask about the amount of time respondents spent doing strengthening activities.

However, the 1977  Field Representative's Manual  notes that if the person works at night, "hours of sleep" referred to the person's normal sleeping hours. Similarly, the 1983 Manual defines "sleep at night" to be the number of hours usually slept, "even if the sample person sleeps during the day."

For surveys prior to 2004, interviewers were instructed to write down responses verbatim.  From 2004 forward, interviewers were instructed to report the hours of sleep in whole numbers, rounding values of 30 minutes or more UP to the nearest hour or otherwise rounding down.

      <labl>Felt everything an effort, past 30 days (adults)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[AEFFORT reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel that everything was an effort?"   

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 stated that the meaning of "everything" was respondent defined. At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Manual for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

AEFFORT is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  


Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)
Nervous? (ANERVOUS)
Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)
Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)
That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)
Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)

As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."  


Scoring Variables

Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of the six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IPUMS NHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IPUMS NHIS) before summing the responses.



Follow-up Questions

As a follow-up to the K6 Scale questions, the NHIS included a question that was not part of Kessler's original survey instrument.   All sample adults who answered "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of the six questions included in the Kessler 6 Scale were asked, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" (AFEELINT1MO).   In 1999, additional follow-up questions collected further information about how "these feelings" affected the person (see FBADHOWOFT, FBADMORE, FBADLESS, FBADUNABLE, and FBADCUTDOWN).

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who reported feeling sad, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless, worthless, or that everything was an effort at least "some of the time" during the past 30 days, AFEELINT1MO reports responses to the question, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" 

The indicators of sample adults' feelings used to determine who was asked this question were based on variables from the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), which was developed by Ronald C. Kessler to measure nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day reference period.  Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt: 

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)
Nervous? (ANERVOUS)
Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)
Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)
That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)
Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)

For each of these questions, respondents selected one of the following responses listed on a flashcard: "none of the time," "a little of the time," "some of the time," "most of the time," "all of the time." 

Interviewers began by noting, "We just talked about a number of feelings you had during the past 30 days."  Sample adults who responded "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of these questions were asked the aforementioned question about how such feelings interfered with their life or activities.   This follow-up question was not part of the tool designed by Kessler to measure nonspecific psychological distress or severe mental illness.]]></txt>

At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Field Representatives Manuals for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

AHOPELESS is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  


Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)
Nervous? (ANERVOUS)
Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)
Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)
That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)
Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)

As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."  


Scoring Variables

Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of these six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IPUMS NHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IPUMS NHIS) before summing the responses.

      <txt><![CDATA[AWORTHLESS reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel worthless?"  

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 stated that the meaning of "worthless" was respondent defined. At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Manual for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

AWORTHLESS is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  

Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)
Nervous? (ANERVOUS)
Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)
Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)
That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)
Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)

As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."  


Scoring Variables

Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of these six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IPUMS NHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IPUMS NHIS) before summing the responses.



Follow-up Questions

As a follow-up to the K6 Scale questions, the NHIS included a question that was not part of Kessler's original survey instrument.   All sample adults who answered "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of the six questions included in the Kessler 6 Scale were asked, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" (AFEELINT1MO).   In 1999, additional follow-up questions collected further information about how "these feelings" affected the person (see FBADHOWOFT, FBADMORE, FBADLESS, FBADUNABLE, and FBADCUTDOWN).

      <labl>Eligibility status for mortality follow-up</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[MORTELIG indicates whether participants in the NHIS during survey years 1986 to 2014 were eligible for follow-up by linkage to National Death Index (NDI) records. Only persons who were age 18+ at the time of interview and who provided sufficient data were eligible for linking to the NDI and eligible for inclusion in the public use files (IPUMS NHIS code 1 in MORTELIG). Linked mortality data for children (IPUMS NHIS code 2) are not available from the NHIS public use files; researchers interested in these data or in material with additional detail should review the documentation for the restricted access NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.].  Adults with insufficient data for matching (IPUMS NHIS code 3) could not be linked to the NDI to create mortality variables.

Linking of Death Records to NHIS participants

The NCHS website provides the following description of the NDI:

The National Death Index (NDI) is a central computerized index of death record information on file in the State vital statistics offices. Working with these State offices, NCHS established the NDI as a resource to aid epidemiologists and other health and medical investigators with their mortality ascertainment activities. [The NDI is] [a]vailable to investigators solely for statistical purposes in medical and health research.

The NCHS has assisted researchers by linking the records for NHIS survey participants with the NDI. The mortality variables in the NHIS public use files (and in IPUMS NHIS) are based on results from probabilistic matches between NHIS records and NDI death certificate records. The NCHS website explains:

Linkage of the NHIS survey participants with the NDI provides the opportunity to conduct studies designed to investigate the association of a variety of health factors with mortality, using the richness of the NHIS questionnaires.

For additional information, see the technical documents from NCHS on the creation and analysis of the NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.].


Appropriate Weights

Because adult survey participants who provided insufficient data for linking may differ from those who provided enough data for linking, ignoring the ineligible adult respondents (IPUMS NHIS code 3 in MORTELIG) could lead to biased mortality analysis. To correct this bias, NCHS developed eligibility-adjusted weights: MORTWT, available for 1986-2014, for use with variables from the NHIS person files, and MORTWTSA, available for 1997-2014, for use with variables from the sample adult files. When analyzing NHIS variables from the person files in conjunction with mortality variables, users should employ MORTWT (rather than the standard person weight, PERWEIGHT).  When analyzing variables from the sample adult files in conjunction with mortality variables, users should employ MORTWTSA (rather than the standard sample weight, SAMPWEIGHT).

      <labl>Leading underlying cause of death (ICD-10)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For persons age 18+ included in the NHIS during survey years 1986 to 2014 who provided sufficient data for linking (MORTELIG) and whose final vital status was judged deceased (MORTSTAT), MORTUCODLD reports the leading underlying cause of death. This information was determined by NCHS based on probabilistic matches of survey participants' NHIS records to National Death Index (NDI) records and aggregated into 10 cause of death categories. For survey respondents in the 2005 or later surveys and decedents who died after December 2006, MORTUCODLD is the most detailed information available on the linked NHIS-NDI public use files about underlying cause of death. For access to the detailed cause of death codes available on the linked NHIS-NDI restricted access files, see documentation on the restricted version of the NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.].

MORTUCODLD is a recode created by NCHS to classify underlying cause of death across 113 categories. Deaths that occurred prior to 1999 are coded based on the 9th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-9). Deaths that occurred from 1999 forward were coded based on the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10).

Weights for Mortality Data

Because adult survey participants who provided insufficient data for linking may differ from those who provided enough data for linking, ignoring the ineligible adult respondents (IPUMS NHIS code 3 in MORTELIG) could lead to biased mortality analysis. To correct this bias, NCHS developed eligibility-adjusted weights: MORTWT, available for 1986-2014, for use with variables from the NHIS person files, and MORTWTSA, available for 1997-2014, for use with variables from the sample adult files. When analyzing NHIS variables from the person files in conjunction with MORTUCODLD, users should employ MORTWT (rather than the standard person weight, PERWEIGHT). When analyzing variables from the sample adult files in conjunction with MORTUCODLD, users should employ MORTWTSA (rather than the standard sample weight, SAMPWEIGHT).

      <txt><![CDATA[MORTWT reports the sampling weight that adjusts for ineligible respondents in mortality analysis based on linking NHIS sample members during survey years 1986 to 2014 to the National Death Index (NDI). 

Because adult survey participants who provided insufficient data for linking may differ from those who provided enough data for linking, ignoring the ineligible adult respondents could lead to biased mortality analysis. To correct this bias, NCHS developed the eligibility-adjusted weight in MORTWT (available for 1987-2014) for use with variables from the NHIS person files and MORTWTSA (available for 1997-2014) for use with variables from the sample adult files.  NCHS cautions that the MORTWT, rather than the standard person weight (PERWEIGHT), should be used when analyzing mortality variables in conjunction with variables from the person files for all years other than 1986..  Similarly, MORTWTSA should be used when analyzing mortality variables in conjunction with variables from the sample adult files. In 1986, NCHS recommends that analysts use values for PERWEIGHT; the IPUMS variable MORTWT in 1986 reports values of PERWEIGHT for persons eligible for mortality follow-up (MORTELIG values of 1)

Linked Mortality Data

Only persons who were age 18+ at the time of interview and who provided sufficient data were eligible for linking to the NDI and eligible for inclusion in the linked public use mortality files (indicated by IPUMS NHIS code 1 in MORTELIG). Linked mortality data for children are not available for public use; researchers interested in access to such data, or in linked mortality data with additional detail, should review the technical documentation for linked restricted access mortality files at NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.].

For additional information, see the variable description for MORTELIG, the IPUMS NHIS User Note on the use of sampling weights [URL omitted from DDI.], and the related technical documents from NCHS, including the material on the creation and analysis of the NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.] and the NHIS Analytic Guidelines (2010) at NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.].

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons age 18+ included in the NHIS during survey years 1986 to 2014 who provided sufficient data for linking (MORTELIG) and whose final vital status was judged deceased (MORTSTAT), MORTDIAB indicates whether, in addition to the leading underlying cause of death (MORTUCODLD ), diabetes was listed as a contributing cause of death. This information was determined by NCHS based on probabilistic matches of survey participants' NHIS records to National Death Index (NDI) records. Diabetes was classified based on an ICD-9 code of 250 for 1986-1998 and on an ICD-10 code of E10-E14 for 1999 forward.

Weights for Mortality Data

Because adult survey participants who provided insufficient data for linking may differ from those who provided enough data for linking, ignoring the ineligible adult respondents (IPUMS NHIS code 3 in MORTELIG) could lead to biased mortality analysis. To correct this bias, NCHS developed eligibility-adjusted weights: MORTWT, available for 1986-2014, for use with variables from the NHIS person files, and MORTWTSA, available for 1997-2014, for use with variables from the sample adult files. When analyzing NHIS variables from the person files in conjunction with mortality variables, users should employ MORTWT (rather than the standard person weight, PERWEIGHT).  When analyzing variables from the sample adult files in conjunction with mortality variables, users should employ MORTWTSA (rather than the standard sample weight, SAMPWEIGHT). 


Related Variables

MORTDIAB is one of three multiple cause of death flags that indicate whether specific health conditions were listed as contributing causes of death (in addition to the underlying cause of death). MORTHIPFX, not available for decedents who died after December 2006, indicates whether hip fracture was listed as a contributing cause of death; and MORTHYPR indicates whether hypertension was listed as a contributing cause of death.

      <txt><![CDATA[MORTWTSA reports the sampling weight that adjusts for ineligible respondents in mortality analysis, based on linking NHIS respondents during survey years 1997 to 2014 to the National Death Index (NDI). 

Because adult survey participants who provided insufficient data for linking may differ from those who provided enough data for linking, ignoring the ineligible adult respondents could lead to biased mortality analysis. To correct this bias, NCHS developed the eligibility-adjusted weight in MORTWTSA.  MORTWTSA is a mortality weight designed for use with sample adult variables and is available for the NHIS years 1997-2014.  (A similar variable, MORTWT, is appropriate for weighting variables from the NHIS person files in conjunction with mortality variables and is available for the NHIS years 1986-2014).  

When analyzing NHIS variables from the sample adult files in conjunction with any of the mortality variables, users should employ MORTWTSA rather than the sample adult weight (SAMPWEIGHT). SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult Weights (for survey years 1997 forward) in the original NHIS public use files.

Linked Mortality Data

Only persons who were at least age 18 at the time of interview and who provided sufficient data (e.g., Social Security number, date of birth, and name) were eligible for linking to the NDI and eligible for inclusion in the linked public use mortality files (indicated by IPUMS NHIS code 1 in MORTELIG). Linked mortality data for children are not available for public use; researchers interested in access to such data, or in linked mortality data with additional detail, should review the technical documentation at NHIS Linked Mortality Files [URL omitted from DDI.].
